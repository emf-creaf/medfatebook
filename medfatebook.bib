abstract = {Widespread tree mortality associated with drought has been observed on all forested continents and global change is expected to exacerbate vegetation vulnerability. Forest mortality has implications for future biosphere-atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy balance, and is poorly represented in dynamic vegetation models. Reducing uncertainty requires improved mortality projections founded on robust physiological processes. However, the proposed mechanisms of drought-induced mortality, including hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, are unresolved. A growing number of empirical studies have investigated these mechanisms, but data have not been consistently analysed across species and biomes using a standardized physiological framework. Here, we show that xylem hydraulic failure was ubiquitous across multiple tree taxa at drought-induced mortality. All species assessed had 60% or higher loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, consistent with proposed theoretical and modelled survival thresholds. We found diverse responses in non-structural carbohydrate reserves at mortality, indicating that evidence supporting carbon starvation was not universal. Reduced non-structural carbohydrates were more common for gymnosperms than angiosperms, associated with xylem hydraulic vulnerability, and may have a role in reducing hydraulic function. Our finding that hydraulic failure at drought-induced mortality was persistent across species indicates that substantial improvement in vegetation modelling can be achieved using thresholds in hydraulic function.},

abstract = {In the Mediterranean region most climatic forecasts predict longer and more intense drought periods that can affect tree growth and mortality over broad geographic regions. One of the silvicultural treatments that has gained currency to lessen the impacts of climatic change is the reduction of stand density by thinning. How-ever, we lack information on how the response of forest stands to different thinning treatments will be affected by climate change, and on the post-thinning temporal dynamics of water balance, specifically blue and green water. We adopted a modelling approach to explore the long-term effects of different thinning intensities on forest dynamics and water balance under climate change scenarios, coupling an individual-based model of forest dynamics (SORTIE-ND) with a mechanistic model of soil moisture dynamics and plant drought stress. We used as a case study three Scots pine plots across a gradient of climatic conditions, and we assessed the effect of site, three climatic scenarios and eight thinning intensities on tree growth, stand productivity, tree drought stress and blue water. The best thinning intensity in terms of stand productivity was obtained when between 20 and 40% of the basal area was removed, whereas the final stand stock rapidly decreased at higher thinning intensities. Moreover, the decrease in final basal area occurred at lower thinning intensities the drier the site conditions. Moderate and heavy thinnings (>30%) doubled basal area increment (BAI) of the follow-ing years in all the plots, although the effect vanished after 30–40 years, independently of the site and climate scenario. As expected, thinning was simulated to have an overall positive effect on the blue water yield and tree water status, which increased and also tended to last longer for higher thinning intensities. However, the magnitude of this effect on tree water status was most dependent on the site and climatic scenario, as drier conditions generally raised stronger and longer lasting reductions in drought stress for a given thinning in-tensity. Furthermore, our results highlight the existence of a site-and climate-dependent trade-off between the gain in stand productivity and the improvement in tree water status obtained by thinning, particularly for moderate or heavy thinning intensities. Our simulations suggest that thinning is a useful management tool to mitigate climate change but strongly argue against the application of general recipes across sites and appeals for carefully taking into consideration local climatic trajectories for management planning.},

abstract = {Stomatal response to environmental conditions forms the backbone of all ecosystem and carbon cycle models, but is largely based on empirical relationships. Evolutionary theories of stomatal behaviour are critical for guarding against prediction errors of empirical models under future cli- mates. Longstanding theory holds that stomata maximise fitness by acting to maintain constant marginal water use efficiency over a given time horizon, but a recent evolutionary theory proposes that stomata instead maximise carbon gain minus carbon costs/risk of hydraulic damage. Using data from 34 species that span global forest biomes, we find that the recent carbon-maximisation optimisation theory is widely supported, revealing that the evolution of stomatal regulation has not been primarily driven by attainment of constant marginal water use efficiency. Optimal con- trol of stomata to manage hydraulic risk is likely to have significant consequences for ecosystem fluxes during drought, which is critical given projected intensification of the global hydrological cycle.},

abstract = {Increasing drought is one of the most critical challenges facing species and ecosystems worldwide, and improved theory and practices are needed for quantification of species tolerances. Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting ($\pi$(tlp) ), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of $\pi$(tlp) and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that $\pi$(tlp) was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both $\pi$(tlp) and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWC(tlp) ) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor ($\pi$(o) ) and bulk modulus of elasticity ($\epsilon$). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that $\pi$(o) is the major driver of $\pi$(tlp) . In contrast, $\epsilon$ plays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain RWC(tlp,) preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Predicting the environmental responses of leaf photosynthesis is central to many models of changes in the future global carbon cycle and terrestrial biosphere. The steady-state biochemical model of C-3 photosynthesis of Farquhar et al. (Planta 149, 78-90, 1980) provides a basis for these larger scale predictions; but a weakness in the application of the model as currently parameterized is the inability to accurately predict carbon assimilation at the range of temperatures over which significant photosynthesis occurs in the natural environment. The temperature functions used in this model have been based on in vitro measurements made over a limited temperature range and require several assumptions of in vivo conditions. Since photosynthetic rates are often Rubisco-limited (ribulose, 1-5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) under natural steady-state conditions, inaccuracies in the functions predicting Rubisco kinetic properties at different temperatures may cause significant error. In this study, transgenic tobacco containing only 10% normal levels of Rubisco were used to measure Rubisco-limited photosynthesis over a large range of CO2 concentrations. From the responses of the rate of CO2 assimilation at a wide range of temperatures, and CO2 and O-2 concentrations, the temperature functions of Rubisco kinetic properties were estimated in vivo. These differed substantially from previously published functions. These new functions were then used to predict photosynthesis in lemon and found to faithfully mimic the observed pattern of temperature response. There was also a close correspondence with published C-3 photosynthesis temperature responses. The results represent an improved ability to model leaf photosynthesis over a wide range of temperatures (10-40 degreesC) necessary for predicting carbon uptake by terrestrial C-3 systems.},

abstract = {The Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model is commonly used in earth system models to simulate biotic regulation of evapotranspiration. However, the dependence of stomatal conductance (gs) on vapor pressure deficit (Ds) and soil moisture must be empirically parameterized. We evaluated the Ball-Berry model used in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and an alternative stomatal conductance model that links leaf gas exchange, plant hydraulic constraints, and the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPA). The SPA model simulates stomatal conductance numerically by (1) optimizing photosynthetic carbon gain per unit water loss while (2) constraining stomatal opening to prevent leaf water potential from dropping below a critical minimum. We evaluated two optimization algorithms: intrinsic water-use efficiency ($\Delta$An /$\Delta$gs, the marginal carbon gain of stomatal opening) and water-use efficiency ($\Delta$An /$\Delta$El, the marginal carbon gain of transpiration water loss). We implemented the stomatal models in a multi-layer plant canopy model to resolve profiles of gas exchange, leaf water potential, and plant hydraulics within the canopy, and evaluated the simulations using leaf analyses, eddy covariance fluxes at six forest sites, and parameter sensitivity analyses. The primary differences among stomatal models relate to soil moisture stress and vapor pressure deficit responses. Without soil moisture stress, the performance of the SPA stomatal model was comparable to or slightly better than the CLM Ball-Berry model in flux tower simulations, but was significantly better than the CLM Ball-Berry model when there was soil moisture stress. Functional dependence of gson soil moisture emerged from water flow along the soil-to-leaf pathway rather than being imposed a priori, as in the CLM Ball-Berry model. Similar functional dependence of gson Ds emerged from the $\Delta$An/$\Delta$ El optimization, but not the $\Delta$An /gsoptimization. Two parameters (stomatal efficiency and root hydraulic conductivity) minimized errors with the SPA stomatal model. The critical stomatal efficiency for optimization ($\iota$) gave results consistent with relationships between maximum An and gsseen in leaf trait data sets and is related to the slope (g1) of the Ball-Berry model. Root hydraulic conductivity (Rr∗) was consistent with estimates from literature surveys. The two central concepts embodied in the SPA stomatal model, that plants account for both water-use efficiency and for hydraulic safety in regulating stomatal conductance, imply a notion of optimal plant strategies and provide testable model hypotheses, rather than empirical descriptions of plant behavior.},

abstract = {Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10–40% per century under current climate and 20–170% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.},

We reconstructed the time course of tracheid enlargement in Pinus sylvestris trees in central Spain by repeated measurements of tracheid diameter on microcores sampled weekly during a 2-year period. We analyzed the role of water availability in these dynamics empirically through time-series correlation analysis and mechanistically by building a model that simulates daily tracheid enlargement rate and duration based on Lockhart's equation and water potential as the sole input. Tracheid enlargement followed a sigmoid-like time course, which varied intra- and inter-annually. Our empirical analysis showed that final tracheid diameter was strongly related to water availability during tracheid enlargement. The mechanistic model was calibrated and successfully validated (R2 =0.92) against the observed tracheid enlargement time course. The model was also able to reproduce the seasonal variations of tracheid enlargement rate, duration and final diameter (R2 =0.84-0.99). Our results support the hypothesis that tracheid enlargement and final dimensions can be modelled based on the direct effect of water potential on turgor-driven cell expansion. We argue that such a mechanism is consistent with other reported patterns of tracheid dimension variation.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystem models based on heuristic water stress functions poorly predict tropical forest response to drought because they do not capture the diversity of hydraulic traits (including variation in tree size) observed in tropical forests. We developed a Richards' equation-based model of plant hydraulics in which all parameters of its constitutive equations are biologically-interpretable and measureable plant hydraulic traits (e.g., turgor loss point $\pi$tlp, bulk elastic modulus $\epsilon$, hydraulic capacitance Cft, xylem hydraulic conductivity ks,max, water potential at 50 % loss of conductivity for both xylem (P50,x) and stomata (P50,gs), and the leaf:sapwood area ratio Al:As). We embedded this plant hydraulics model within a forest simulator (TFS) that modeled individual tree light environments and their upper boundary condition (transpiration) as well as provided a means for parameterizing individual variation in hydraulic traits. We synthesized literature and existing databases to parameterize all hydraulic traits as a function of stem and leaf traits wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA) and photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and evaluated the coupled model's (TFS-Hydro) predictions against diurnal and seasonal variability in stem and leaf water potential as well as stand-scaled sap flux. Our hydraulic trait synthesis revealed coordination among leaf and xylem hydraulic traits and statistically significant relationships of most hydraulic traits with more easily measured plant traits. Using the most informative empirical trait-trait relationships derived from this synthesis, the TFS-Hydro model parameterization is capable of representing patterns of coordination and trade-offs in hydraulic traits. TFS-Hydro successfully captured individual variation in leaf and stem water potential due to increasing tree size and light environment, with model representation of hydraulic architecture and plant traits exerting primary and secondary controls, respectively, on the fidelity of model predictions. The plant hydraulics model made substantial improvements to simulations of total ecosystem transpiration under control conditions, but the absence of a vertically stratified soil hydrology model precluded improvements to the simulation of drought response. Remaining uncertainties and limitations of the trait paradigm for plant hydraulics modeling are highlighted.},

abstract = {Phenology refers to recurring plant and animal life cycle stages, such as leafing and flowering, maturation of agricultural plants, emergence of insects, and migration of birds. It is also the study of these recurring events, especially their timing and relationships with weather and climate. Phenological phenomena all give a ready measure of the environment as viewed by the associated organism, and are thus ideal indicators of the impact of local and global changes in weather and climate on the earth's biosphere. Assessing our changing world is a complex task that requires close cooperation from experts in biology, climatology, ecology, geography, oceanography, remote sensing, and other areas. Like its predecessor, this second edition of Phenology is a synthesis of current phenological knowledge, designed as a primer on the field for global change and general scientists, students, and interested members of the public. With updated and new contributions from over fifty phenological experts, covering data collection, current research, methods, and applications, it demonstrates the accomplishments, progress over the last decade, and future potential of phenology as an integrative environmental science.},

@article{Collatz1991,
abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20-35??C), CO2 concentrations (10-90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5-3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100-2000 ??mol m-2s-1). The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux (??E) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the 'big-leaf' approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of ??E and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and ??E. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and ??E. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Recent improvements to the Hadley Centre climate model include the introduction of a new land surface scheme called MOSES (Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme). MOSES is built on the previous scheme, but incorporates in addition an interactive plant photosynthesis and conductance module, and a new soil thermodynamics scheme which simulates the freezing and melting of soil water, and takes account of the dependence of soil thermal characteristics on the frozen and unfrozen components. The impact of these new features is demonstrated by comparing 1×CO2 and 2×CO2 climate simulations carried out using the old (UKMO) and new (MOSES) land surface schemes. MOSES is found to improve the simulation of current climate. Soil water freezing tends to warm the high-latitude land in the northern Hemisphere during autumn and winter, whilst the increased soil water availability in MOSES alleviates a spurious summer drying in the mid-latitudes. The interactive canopy conductance responds directly to CO2, supressing transpiration as the concentration increases and producing a significant enhancement of the warming due to the radiative effects of CO2 alone.},

abstract = {The annual timing of temperate forest leaf colouring is affected by climate change; to date, its modelling remains a challenge. We take advantage of a ca. 400 leaf colouring observations database acquired in France during the period of 1997-2006 in order to develop a new modelling framework aimed at predicting the spatial and year-to-year variability of leaf colouring in European beech and oak (Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Quercus robur L.). We postulate colouring to be the outcome of a one-way process triggered by photoperiod and progressing through a photoperiod-sensitive cold-degree day summation procedure. Observations were pooled according to genus for the fitting and ensuing validation procedures. Parameters of the model suggest that colouring processes start earlier, and are sensitive to higher temperatures for Quercus than for Fagus. Errors associated with the modelled predictions are up to 13.0 days in Fagus and 10.3 days in Quercus, which are significantly lower than errors associated with (1) the overall mean (null model) or (2) previously published modelling frameworks. When averaged on a site basis, model predictions reproduced spatial variability of leaf colouring over the French territory with good efficiency (modelling efficiencies: 0.44 for Fagus, 0.45 for Quercus). The interannual variability of leaf colouring over France was fairly reproduced (r2 = 0.74 for Fagus, 0.83 for Quercus). On that basis, we claim that the modelling framework developed herein can be efficiently integrated into more general schemes aimed at simulating matter and energy fluxes on a regional scale, and we provide a generic parameterisation of the model to be integrated into such schemes. When used in a prospective analysis, the model predicts a trend towards delay in leaf colouring of 1.4 and 1.7 days per decade in Fagus and Quercus, respectively, over the period of 1951-2099 in France. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This note describes the improvements to the Unified Model (UM) soil hydraulic and thermal properties implemented in Parallel Suite 18 (PS18) that became operational in April 2008. Also described are trials of a two-stream multi-layer canopy radiation scheme that has been implemented in PS20 and became operational in November 2008. The soil hydraulic properties affect the soils ability to hold water and the rate at which water moves through the soil. The soil moisture together with the soil hydraulic properties control transpiration from plants and direct evaporation from bare soil. The UM soil hydraulic properties are derived using the Cosby et al (1984) equations from information about soil texture; fractions of sand, silt and clay particles. Also, the soil thermal conductivity and heat capacity both depend on soil moisture and soil texture, so that these properties in turn influence the land surface temperature. Thus, soil moisture and the soil physical properties control the partitioning of net surface radiation into sensible, latent and ground heat fluxes. Improvements to the calculation of the soil thermal conductivity result in a reduction of the models northern hemisphere (NH) summer warm bias by about 0{\textperiodcentered}2 K and a reduction in the models NH winter cold bias by over 0{\textperiodcentered}5 K. Average errors in screen temperature for the NH winter are reduced by about 10%. During the summer, the new soil thermal conductivity gives a greater flow of heat from the surface into the ground which results in atmospheric cooling. While in winter, there is a greater flow of heat from the ground towards the surface resulting in a warming of the atmosphere. The direction of the ground heat flux depends on the vertical temperature gradient. Improvements to the model soil hydraulic parameters are found to significantly increase the model soil moisture, by reducing surface evaporation. The new soil hydraulic properties also significantly reduce errors in screen temperature and humidity. However, by reducing surface evaporation, the new soil hydraulic parameters cause the model to become warmer during the summer. The new two-stream multi-layer canopy radiation scheme is found to cool the model by about 0{\textperiodcentered}25 K during the summer. In our trials, the effect of the full changes is to eliminate the UM NH summer warm bias.},

In woody plants, fundamental questions about NSC remain unresolved: Is NSC storage an active or passive process? Do older NSC reserves remain accessible to the plant? How is NSC depletion related to mortality risk? Herein we review conceptual and mathematical models of NSCdynamics, recent observations and experiments at the organismal scale, and advances in plant physiology that have provided a better understanding of the dynamics of woody plant NSC. Plants preferentially use new carbon but can access decade-old carbon when the plant is stressed or physically damaged. In addition to serving as a carbon and energy source, NSC plays important roles in phloem transport, osmoregulation, and cold tolerance, but how plants regulate these competing roles and NSC depletion remains elusive. Moving forward requires greater synthesis of models and data and integration across scales from -omics to ecology.},

abstract = {Knowledge of future terrestrial carbon (C) pools and fluxes is based on simulations by Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs; Cox et al., 2000; Sitch et al., 2008). For simplicity we used the DGVMs acronym to include all of the models able to simulate C and vegetation dynamics at large spatial scales, which are sometime referred to as Terrestrial Biosphere Models, Terrestrial Ecosystem Models, vegetation components of Earth System Models, and Land Ecosystem Models. DGVMs are now typically coupled to climate models to account for biophysical and biogeochemical feedback caused by vegetation (Bonan, 2008; Chapin et al., 2008; Anderson et al., 2011). The ultimate aim is to simulate climate–vegetation dynamics that explicitly account for mutual interactions and thus provide us with a better spatiotemporal description of water fluxes together with the most realistic scenarios for the future climate and C cycle (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Thornton et al., 2007; Bonan et al., 2011). Current DGVMs are simulating long-term tree and forest stand growth as a consequence of the amount of assimilated C, triggering an inevitable positive feedback betweenCassimilation and growth. The key factors affecting stomatal aperture and C assimilation are atmospheric CO2 concentration, water availability, light, vapor pressure deficit and temperature (Sellers et al., 1997; Lawson et al., 2011).However, direct control of Csinks (defined as growth in the sense of Cinvestment on plant tissue expansion) via environmental factors has been shown to be more important than indirect control via photosynthesis (theCsource, see Fig. 1). For example, water- or temperature-limited plants tend to reduce growth but increase C storage (K€orner, 2003; Sala&Hoch, 2009; Woodruff&Meinzer, 2011; Sala et al., 2012), which suggests that environmental controls act first on sink activity rather than source activity (K€orner, 2013). Nevertheless, in all existing DGVMs, plant growth is driven by photosynthesis directly without considering water and thermal limitations via metabolic, cambial and meristematic activity (blue arrows in Fig. 1; Bonan et al., 2003; Sitch et al., 2003; Krinner et al., 2005). The entire photosynthesized netC(the source) is then partitioned among different C pools, mostly based on allometric rules derived from observations (Poorter et al., 2012) or using simplified functional allocation schemes (Friedlingstein et al., 1998; Franklin et al., 2012). Allocation to carbohydrate reserves, root exudates and export to symbionts are mostly missing. This opens up a huge discrepancy between the way plant growth is modeled today (blue arrows in Fig. 1) and the way it is understood based on experimental evidence (red arrows in Fig. 1). In this article, we suggest a revised hierarchy of plant growth control by removing the causal link from C assimilation to plant growth and by providing a description of the mechanistic connections among processes},

abstract = {Radiation exchange at the surface plays a critical role in the surface energy balance, plant microclimate, and plant growth. The ability to simulate the surface energy balance and the microclimate within the plant canopy is contingent upon simulation of the surface radiation exchange. A validation and modification exercise of the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model was conducted for simulating the surface short-wave and long-wave radiation exchange over and within wheat, maize and soya bean plant canopies using data collected at Yucheng in the North China Plain and near Ames, Iowa. Whereas model testing was limited to monocultures and mixed canopies of green and senesced leaves, methodologies were developed for simulating short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes applicable to a multi-species, multi-layer plant canopy. Although the original SHAW model slightly underpredicted reflected solar radiation with a mean bias error (MBE) of -5 to -10 W m-2, one would conclude that the simulations were quite reasonable if within-canopy measurements were not available. However, within-canopy short-wave radiation was considerably underestimated (MBE of approximately -20 W m-2) by the original SHAW model. Additionally, leaf temperatures tended to be overpredicted (MBE = +0.76 °C) near the top of the canopy and underpredicted near the bottom (MBE = -1.12 °C). Modification to the SHAW model reduced MBE of above canopy reflected radiation to -1 to -6 W m-2 and within-canopy radiation simulations to approximately -6 W m-2; bias in leaf temperature was reduced to less than 0.4 °C. Model modifications resulted in essentially no change in simulated evapotranspiration for wheat, 4.5% lower for maize and 1% higher for soya bean. Alternative approaches for simulating canopy transmissivity to diffuse radiation were tested in the modified version and had a minor influence on simulated short-wave radiation, but made almost no difference in simulated long-wave radiation or evapotranspiration. Modifications to the model should lead to more accurate plant microclimate simulation; further work is needed to evaluate their influence. {\textcopyright} 2009 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.},

Measurements were carried out with a gravity driven high pressure viscometer with a maximum pressure of 700 MPa. The influence of both concentration and temperature on the pressure dependence of the viscosity is considered. Next to the data, a viscosity model based on a suspension model is introduced and it is shown that it is able to predict the viscosity for sugar solutions in a broad parameter range, including pressure. It is demonstrated that the relative viscosity for varying sugar mass fraction at constant pressure coincides with the pressure-dependent relative viscosity for a fixed sugar mass fraction, suggesting that there are no structural changes occurring under pressure. A brief interpretation of the viscosity model is given.},

abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial-temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A numerical process-based model of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics is described and tested. The model, Hybrid v3.0, treats the daily cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water within the biosphere and between the biosphere and the atmosphere. It combines a mass-balance approach with the capacity to predict the relative dominance of different species or generalised plant types (such as evergreen needleleaved trees, cold deciduous broadleaved trees, and C3 grasses). The growth of individual trees is simulated on an annual timestep, and the growth of a grass layer is simulated on a daily timestep. The exchange of carbon, nitrogen, and water with the atmosphere and the soil is simulated on a daily timestep (except the flux of tree litter to the soil, which occurs annually). Individual trees and the grass layer compete with each other for light, water, and nitrogen within a 'plot'. Larger and taller plants shade smaller ones; they also take up a greater proportion of the available water and nitrogen. The above-ground space in each plot is divided into 1 m deep layers for the purposes of calculating irradiance interception; horizontal variation in the plot environment is not treated. The soil is represented as a single layer, with a daily hydrological budget. Decomposition of soil organic matter is calculated using an empirical sub-model. The initial size of each tree seedling is stochastic. To predict the mean behaviour of the model for a particular boundary condition it is necessary to simulate a number of plots. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with three major requirements in mind: (i) the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles must be fully coupled in the soil-plant-atmosphere system; (ii) the internal constraints on the model's behaviour, and the driving forces for the model, must be the same as those which operate in nature (e.g., climate, nitrogen deposition, and the atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and 02); and (iii) the model must be constructed so that it is capable of predicting transient as well as equilibrium responses to climate change. These conditions have largely been met by constructing the model around a set of fundamental hypotheses regarding the general constraints under which plants and soils behave, independently of any particular location or time. The model is thus potentially capable of making reliable predictions of ecosystem behaviour and structure under future, new, amaospheric conditions. The model is tested for a site in eastern North America. A quasi-equilibrium is reached after approximately 250 years with 10 plots. It is found that more plots are not necessary in order to obtain a reliable estimate of mean behaviour. Predictions of productivity, leaf area index, foliage nitrogen, soil carbon, and biomass carbon are all within the range expected for this location.},

abstract = {The extent to which wood growth is limited by carbon (C) supply (i.e. source control) or by cambial activity (i.e. sink control) will strongly determine the responses of trees to global changes. Nevertheless, the physiological processes that are responsible for limiting forest growth are still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the key determinants of the annual C allocation to wood along large soil and climate regional gradients over France. The study was conducted for five tree species representative of the main European forest biomes (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Quercus ilex, Quercus robur and Picea abies). The drivers of stand biomass growth were assessed on both inter-site and inter-annual scales. Our data set comprised field measurements performed at 49 sites (931 site-years) that included biometric measurements and a variety of stand characteristics (e.g. soil water holding capacity, leaf area index). It was complemented with process-based simulations when possible explanatory variables could not be directly measured (e.g. annual and seasonal tree C balance, bioclimatic water stress indices). Specifically, the relative influences of tree C balance (source control), direct environmental control (water and temperature controls of sink activity) and allocation adjustments related to age, past climate conditions, competition intensity and soil nutrient availability on growth were quantified. The inter-site variability in the stand C allocation to wood was predominantly driven by age-related decline. The direct effects of temperature and water stress on sink activity (i.e. effects independent from their effects on the C supply) exerted a strong influence on the annual stand wood growth in all of the species considered, including deciduous temperate species. The lagged effect of the past environmental conditions (e.g. the previous year's water stress and low C uptake) significantly affected the annual C allocation to wood. The C supply appeared to strongly limit growth only in temperate deciduous species. We provide an evaluation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the annual C allocation to wood in French forests. Our study supports the premise that the growth of European tree species is subject to complex control processes that include both source and sink limitations. The relative influences of the growth drivers strongly vary with time and across spatial ecological gradients. We suggest a straightforward modelling framework with which to implement these combined forest growth limitations into terrestrial biosphere models.},

abstract = {Summary Determining physiological mechanisms and thresholds for climate-driven tree die-off could help improve global predictions of future terrestrial carbon sinks. We directly tested for the lethal threshold in hydraulic failure—an inability to move water due to drought-induced xylem embolism—in a pine sapling experiment. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) saplings (n=83) to drought-induced water stress ranging from mild to lethal. Before re-watering to relieve drought stress, we measured native hydraulic conductivity and foliar color change. We monitored all measured individuals for survival or mortality. We found a lethal threshold at 80% loss of hydraulic conductivity—a point of hydraulic failure beyond which it is more likely trees will die, than survive, and describe mortality risk across all levels of water stress. Foliar color changes lag hydraulic failure—best predicting when trees have been dead for some time, rather than when they are dying. Our direct measurement of native conductivity, while monitoring the same individuals for survival or mortality, quantifies a continuous probability of mortality risk from hydraulic failure. Predicting tree die-off events and understanding mechanism requires knowledge not only of when trees are dead, but when they begin dying—having passed the point of no return.

abstract = {A crown ratio model for individual trees is developed for all major tree species in Austria. The study is part of a comprehensive project developing a distance-independent single tree growth simulator for the full range of stand conditions in Austria. Data were obtained from the Austrian National Forest Inventory and consist of more than 42 000 trees growing on over 5000 permanent plots measured during 1981 and 1985. Crown ratio was predicted using nonlinear regression with a logistic function. The argument of the logistic was a linear combination of tree size characteristics, stand density measures, and topographic site factors. The total variation explained by the model varied from 49% for larch to 17% for the 'other broadleaf species'. The model explained 41% of the variation in crown ratio for the principal species, Norway spruce. The model explained less than a quarter of the variation for all the broadleaf species and for stone pine. The effect of the size variables is approximately equal in importance to the variables representing competition for the major species. The set of topographic site factors explained the least amount of variation, less than 10% in all cases. Because the height/diameter ratio, the most important size variable, can also be considered to be an integrator of past competition, the crown ratio model is dominated by competition measures. A validation test using independent data from permanent research plots for the main species (Norway spruce, white fir, Scots pine, and beech) demonstrated that the models appear to be well behaved and robust for both pure even-aged and mixed uneven-aged stand types in Austria. Analyses of the residuals from permanent research plots representing a wide variety of thinning treatments indicate that the effect of management seems to be adequately represented by the model.},

abstract = {Mortality as a basic process should be an integral part of any model of woody plant dynamics. But progress in developing mortality algorithms is slow. The aim of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art description of mortality algorithms in published plant growth models, their structure, and the problems they face. The subsequent objective is to assess how models attempt to solve the problems, and provide some insight on how modelling mortality can be improved. Sixty-one models, concerned with forest yield and dieback and forest/shrubland dynamics, were reviewed, the greatest proportion being the gap type. The algorithms could be broadly divided into stochastic and deterministic. Despite considerable variability, the basic premise of every algorithm was the same: beyond a specified threshold a plant either dies (deterministic), or has a greater probability of dying (stochastic). Factors used to predict mortality include size, age, competition, carbon balance (growth) and abiotic influences. Some algorithms were random, and one-third used more than one predictor. Although the classification is far from clear-cut, mortality algorithms can be placed in one or more of the following classes: carbon-based, abiotic/age-based, competitive, gap-type, statistically fitted and progressive-stress type. It is clear both that mortality is difficult to model, and that there is no best way to model it for all applications. The complexity of environmental stresses and lack of process information of woody plant mortality has however led to the wide use of empirical algorithms. These have many problems, including data intensity and spatial and temporal specificity. Such problems render mortality simulation prone to error and weak in response to environmental change. Test data and procedures also are lacking. In the literature suggested improvements to the problem include the use of mechanistic algorithms. But this approach also has associated problems. So here it is suggested here that the use of a biologically reasonable predictor in a simple stochastic algorithm, used within a mechanistic model of plant growth, is a preferable improvement. The approach provides a mechanistic-empirical consensus. A shift in emphasis towards modelling for exploration and explanation, rather than to predict with high levels of accuracy is also suggested.

abstract = {Embolisms decrease plant hydraulic conductance and therefore reduce the ability of the xylem to transport water to leaves provided that embolized conduits are not refilled. However, as a xylem conduit is filled with gas during cavitation, water is freed to the transpiration stream and this transiently increases xylem water potential. This capacitive effect of embolism formation on plant function has not been explicitly quantified in the past. A dynamic model is presented that models xylem water potential, xylem sap flow and cavitation, taking into account both the decreasing hydraulic conductance and the water release effect of xylem embolism. The significance of the capacitive effect increases in relation to the decreasing hydraulic conductance effect when transpiration rate is low in relation to the total amount of water in xylem conduits. This ratio is typically large in large trees and during drought.},

abstract = {Trees must simultaneously balance their CO2 uptake rate via stomata, photosynthesis, the transport rate of sugars and rate of sugar utilization in sinks while maintaining a favourable water and carbon balance. We demonstrate using a numerical model that it is possible to understand stomatal functioning from the viewpoint of maximizing the simultaneous photosynthetic production, phloem transport and sink sugar utilization rate under the limitation that the transpiration-driven hydrostatic pressure gradient sets for those processes. A key feature in our model is that non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis increase with decreasing leaf water potential and/or increasing leaf sugar concentration and are thus coupled to stomatal conductance. Maximizing the photosynthetic production rate using a numerical steady-state model leads to stomatal behaviour that is able to reproduce the well-known trends of stomatal behaviour in response to, e.g., light, vapour concentration difference, ambient CO2 concentration, soil water status, sink strength and xylem and phloem hydraulic conductance. We show that our results for stomatal behaviour are very similar to the solutions given by the earlier models of stomatal conductance derived solely from gas exchange considera- tions. Our modelling results also demonstrate how the ‘marginal cost of water' in the unified stomatal conductance model and the optimal stomatal model could be related to plant structural and physiological traits, most importantly, the soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance},

abstract = {The predictive skills of single- and two-equation (or K-$\epsilon$) models to compute profiles of mean velocity (U), turbulent kinetic energy (K), and Reynolds stresses (u′w′) are compared against datasets collected in eight vegetation types and in a flume experiment. These datasets range in canopy height h from 0.12 to 23 m, and range in leaf area index (LAI) from 2 to 10m2 m-2. We found that for all datasets and for both closure models, measured and modelled U, K, and (u′w′) agree well when the mixing length (lm) is a priori specified. In fact, the root-mean squared error between measured and modelled U, K, and (u′w′) is no worse than published values for second- and third-order closure approaches. Within the context of one-dimensional modelling, there is no clear advantage to including a turbulent kinetic dissipation ($\epsilon$) budget when lm can be specified instead. The broader implication is that the added complexity introduced by the e budget in K-$\epsilon$ models need not translate into improved predictive skills of U, K, and (u′w′) profiles when compared to single-equation models. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

While acknowledging the importance of co-drivers, the classical view is still that carbon, that is, photosynthetic CO2uptake, ranks above any other drivers of plant growth. Hence, theory and modelling of growth traditionally is carbon centric. Here, I suggest that this view is not reflecting reality, but emerged from the availability of methods and process understanding at leaf level. In most cases, poorly understood processes of tissue formation and cell growth are governing carbon demand, and thus, CO2uptake. Carbon can only be converted into biomass to the extent chemical elements other than carbon, temperature or cell turgor permit.},

abstract = {1. Habitat specialization models predict that adaptations to environmental conditions explain species distributions. In tropical rainforests, the ability of the seedlings to survive during drought has been shown to be a key determinant of species distributions. We hypothesize that differences among species in their tolerance to low tissue water status is the mechanism underlying differences in performance during drought. 2. To test this hypothesis we quantified tolerance to low leaf water status for over 20 species from central Panama in screenhouse experiments using two different experimental approaches. Results from both approaches were highly correlated with each other. 3. We found that tolerance to low leaf water status correlated with species drought performance in the field and with their distribution across a gradient of dry season length, with the more desiccation-tolerant species having higher survival in dry relative to irrigated conditions, and occurring in drier areas. These results support the hypothesis that, in tropical forests, tolerance to low tissue water status governs seedling performance during drought, as well as being a determinant of species distribution patterns. 4. Lower tolerance to low leaf water status was correlated with greater stem hydraulic conductance. In addition, all species tested, including both desiccation-sensitive and desiccation-resistant species, showed similar losses of xylem conductance, about 80%, when near death. These results suggest that a principal mechanism by which desiccation leads to plant mortality is the loss of xylem conductivity. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

There was remarkable conformity in V-cmax and J(max) between all plants at T-leaf < 25 &DEG;C, when each parameter was normalized by their respective values at 25 &DEG;C (V-cmax0 and J(max0)), but showed a high degree of variability between and within species at T-leaf > 30 degreesC. For both normalized V (cmax) and J (max) , the maximum fractional error introduced by assuming a common temperature response function is < +/- 0.1 for most plants and < +/- 0.22 for all plants when T-leaf < 25 &DEG;C. Fractional errors are typically < +/- 0.45 in the temperature range 25-30 degreesC, but very large errors occur when a common function is used to estimate the photosynthetic parameters at temperatures > 30 degreesC. The ratio J(max) /V-cmax varies with temperature, but analysis of the ratio at T-leaf = 25 degreesC using the fitted mean temperature response functions results in J (max0)/V-cmax0 = 2.00 +/- 0.60 (SD, n = 43).},

abstract = {Forest canopies play a critical role in affecting momentum and scalar transfer. Although there have been recent advances in numerical simulations of turbulent flows and scalar transfer across plant canopies and the atmosphere interface, few models have incorporated all important physical and physiological processes in subcanopy layers. Here we describe and evaluate an advanced multiple-layer canopy module (MCANOPY), which is developed based largely on the Community Land Model version 4.5 and then coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model with large-eddy simulations (WRF-LES). The MCANOPY includes a suite of subcanopy processes, including radiation transfer, photosynthesis, canopy layer energy balance, momentum drag, and heat, water vapor, and CO2 exchange between canopy layers and the canopy atmosphere. Numerical schemes for heat and water transport in soil, ground surface energy balance, and soil respiration are also included. Both the stand-alone MCANOPY and the coupled system (the WRF-LES-MCANOPY) are evaluated against data measured in the Canopy Horizontal Array Turbulence Study field experiment. The MCANOPY performs reasonably well in reproducing vertical profiles of mean and turbulent flows as well as second-order statistical quantities including heat and scalar fluxes within the canopy under unstable stability conditions. The coupled WRF-LES-MCANOPY captures major features of canopy edge flows under both neutral and unstable conditions. Limitations of the MCANOPY are discussed for our further work. Our results suggest that our model can be a promising modeling system for a variety of applications to study canopy flows and scalar transport (e.g., CO2).},

abstract = {The decline in above-ground net primary productivity (Pa) that is usually observed in forest stands has been variously attributed to respiration, nutrient or hydraulic limitations. A novel model is proposed to explain the phenomenon and the co-occurring changes in the balance between foliage, conducting sapwood and fine roots. The model is based on the hypothesis that a functional homeostasis in water transport is maintained irrespective of age: hydraulic resistances through the plant must be finely tuned to transpiration rates so as to avoid extremely negative water potentials that could result in diffuse xylem embolism and foliage dieback, in agreement with experimental evidence. As the plant grows taller, allocation is predicted to shift from foliage to transport tissues, most notably to fine roots. Higher respiration and fine root turnover would result in the observed decline in Pa. The predictions of the model have been compared with experimental data from a chronosequence of Pinus sylvestris stands. The observed reduction in Pa is conveniently explained by concurrent modifications in leaf area index and plant structure. Changes in allometry and shoot hydraulic conductance with age are successfully pre- dicted by the principle of functional homeostasis.},

abstract = {10 Plant resistance to drought has long been thought to be associated with the ability to maintain 11 transpiration and photosynthesis longer during drought, through the opening of stomata. This premise 12 is at the root of most current framework used to assess drought impacts on land plants in vegetation 13 models. We examined this premise by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits of stomatal response 14 to drought (i.e. the water potential causing stomatal closure, $\psi$close) and embolism resistance (the water 15 potential at the onset of embolism formation, $\Psi$12), with simulations from a soil-plant hydraulic model. 16 We found that $\psi$close and $\Psi$12 were equal (isometric) only for a restricted number of species, but as $\Psi$12 17 decreases, the departure from isometry increases, with stomatal closure occurring far before embolism 18 occurs. For the most drought resistant species ($\Psi$12<-4.2 MPa), $\Psi$close was remarkably independent of 19 embolism resistance and remained above -4.5 MPa, suggesting the existence of a restrictive boundary 20 by which stomata closure must occur. This pattern was supported by model simulations. Indeed, 21 coordinated decrease in both $\psi$close and $\psi$12 leads to unsuspected accelerated death under drought for 22 embolism resistant species, in contradiction with observations from drought mortality experiments. 23 Overall our results highlight that most species have similarity in stomatal behavior, and are highly 24 conservative in terms of their water use during drought.

abstract = {Summary Drought-induced tree mortality has major impacts on ecosystem carbon and water cycles, and is expected to increase in forests across the globe with climate change. A large body of research in the past decade has advanced our understanding of plant water and carbon relations under drought. However, despite intense research, we still lack generalizable, cross-scale indicators of mortality risk. In this Viewpoint, we propose that a more explicit consideration of water pools could improve our ability to monitor and anticipate mortality risk. Specifically, we focus on the relative water content (RWC), a classic metric in plant water relations, as a potential indicator of mortality risk that is physiologically relevant and integrates different aspects related to hydraulics, stomatal responses and carbon economy under drought. Measures of plant water content are likely to have a strong mechanistic link with mortality and to be integrative, threshold-prone and relatively easy to measure and monitor at large spatial scales, and may complement current mortality metrics based on water potential, loss of hydraulic conductivity and nonstructural carbohydrates. We discuss some of the potential advantages and limitations of these metrics to improve our capacity to monitor and predict drought-induced tree mortality.},

abstract = {Events of regional-scale vegetation mortality appear to be increasing in a variety of biomes throughout Earth and are frequently associated with increased temperatures, droughts, and often (but not always) with outbreaks of biotic agents such as insects and pathogens (for review, see Allen et al., 2010; Supplemental Information SI). The precise physiological mechanisms underlying plant mortality are poorly understood, which limits prediction of where, when, and how vegetation will change with future climatic photosynthesis and the mobilization of nonstructural variation (for review, see Supplemental Information S2). In particular, hypotheses regarding carbon starvation (failure to maintain metabolism or fend off biotic agents due to prolonged negative carbohydrate balance) and hydraulic failure (desiccation from failed water transport) have stimulated recent debate (Adams et al., 2009a, 2009b; Leuzinger et al., 2009; Sala, 2009; McDowell and Sevanto, 2010; Sala et al., 2010). In this Update, I offer a perspective on the mechanisms of drought-induced mortality by providing an integrated view of carbon metabolism in relation to stress and mortality, linking carbon metabolism with new evidence on the role of hydraulic failure in mortality, and identifying associated uncertainties. Drought is the predominant climate characteristic associated with mortality (Allen et al., 2010), but there are parallels with low temperature, light, and paleo-C02 concentrations, from which I have cautiously drawn evidence regarding mechanisms of drought-induced mortality. Two novel results emerged from this review. First, well-known carbohydrate partitioning patterns are consistent with observations of carbohydrate concentrations in stressed but surviving plants as well as those that are dying, and these results support carbon starvation as a threat to survival during drought. Second, carbon metabolism and hydraulics are coupled via multiple interactions that are only recently becoming appreciated, including an enhanced risk of mortality in species that maintain narrow margins of the hydraulic safety.},

abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

abstract = {A process-based model is described and applied to a range of Pinus radiata D. Don stands, aged 9-12 years, growing on stabilised sand dunes in a stocking ?? fertiliser experiment in Woodhill State Forest, New Zealand. The model requires inputs of daily weather data (maximum and minimum air temperatures and rainfall), physical characteristics of the site (longitude, latitude, rootzone depth and relationship between root-zone soil matric potential and volumetric water-content) and crop (stocking, crown dimensions and leaf-area index) and crop physiological parameters (e.g., maximum stomatal conductance). The model was used to simulate components of the forest water-balance and annual net photosynthesis for a defined crop canopy architecture. Simulated daily root-zone water storage in both open and closed canopy stands generally agreed with monthly measurements made over a complete year. Simulated net annual photosynthesis ranged from 23 to 33 t C ha-1 year-1 and comparison with measured stem-volume increments of 12-38 m3 ha-1 year-1 over the same time periods resulted in a strong positive correlation. Ratios of stem-volume increment to net photosynthesis suggested that fertilised and unfertilised stands had a 26 and 14%, respetively, allocation of C to stem growth. Simulations using weather data for a dry year with 941 mm year-1 rainfall indicated that annual net photosynthesis and transpiration of fully stocked stands were reduced by 41 and 45%, respectively, compared to those in a wet year with 153 mm year-1 rainfall. Operational applications of the model to forest management in quantifying environmental requirements for stand growth and examining silvicultural alternatives are discussed. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {Responses of plant processes to temperature may vary according to the time scale on which they are measured. In this study, both short-term and seasonal responses of photosynthesis to temperature were examined. A field study of seasonal changes in the temperature response of photosynthesis was conducted on two provenances, French and Moroccan, of mature maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Measurements were made every 2 months over a 1-year period and used to parameterize a mechanistic model of photosynthesis. Temperature responses of maximum Rubisco activity, Vcmax, and potential electron transport rate, Jmax, were obtained for each measurement period, as was the response of stomatal conductance, gs, to water vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Absolute values of Vcmax and Jmax at 25 °C were related to needle nitrogen content, Narea.Narea, and thus Vcmax and Jmax, were negatively correlated with the mean minimum temperature in the month preceding measurements. The ratio of Jmax : Vcmax at 25 °C varied between 1 and 1{\textperiodcentered}7 but did not show any seasonal trend. Nor was there any seasonal trend in the relative temperature response of Vcmax, which had an activation energy Ha of approximately 57 kJ mol−1 throughout the experiment. The activation energy of Jmax was also close to constant throughout the experiment, averaging 39 kJ mol−1. For the French provenance, the optimal temperature of Jmax was positively correlated with the maximum temperature of the previous day, but no such correlation was found for the Moroccan provenance. The response of gs to VPD also varied seasonally, with much stronger stomatal closure in winter months. Taken together, these results implied a translational shift downwards of the photosynthetic temperature response curve with increasing Tprev, and a shift in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis of 5–10 °C between summer and winter. These results illustrate that the short-term temperature response of photosynthesis varies significantly on a seasonal basis.},

Two stands of the same provenance were selected, one in western Scotland and one in eastern England, so that effects resulting from age, genetic variability, density and fertility were minimized. Compared with the Scots pine trees at the cooler and wetter site in Scotland, the trees at the warmer and drier site in England produced less leaf area per unit of conducting sapwood area both at a stem height of 1.3 m and at the base of the live crown, whereas stem permeability was similar at both sites. Also, trees at the drier site had less leaf area per unit branch cross-sectional area at the branch base than trees at the wetter site. For each site, the average values for leaf area, sapwood area and permeability were used, together with values of transpiration rates at different D, to calculate average stem water potential gradients. Changes in the leaf area/sapwood area ratio acted to maintain a similar water potential gradient in the stems of trees at both sites despite climatic differences between the sites.},

abstract = {Allometric equations for the estimation of crown fuel weight of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) trees in the Mediterranean Basin were developed. Forty trees were destructively sampled and their crown fuels were weighed separately for each fuel category. Crown fuel components, both living and dead, were separated into size classes and regression equations that estimate crown fuel load by diameter class were derived. The allometric equation y = axb with diameter at breast height as the single predictor was chosen, because the addition of other parameters did not decrease the residual sum of squares significantly. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj) values were high (R2adj = 0.82{\^{a}}0.88) in all cases. Diameter at breast height was the most significant determinant of crown fuel biomass. The aerial fuels that are consumed during crown fires (i.e. needles and twigs with diameter less than 0.63 cm) comprised 29.3% of the total crown weight. Live fuels constituted $\sim$96.3% of total crown biomass, distributed as follows: needles 16.7% (average load 12.07 kg), branches with 0.0{\^{a}}0.63-cm diameter 12.6% (average load 9.18 kg), 0.64{\^{a}}2.5-cm diameter 37.3% (27.99 kg), 2.51{\^{a}}7.5-cm diameter 25.4% (18.59 kg), and >7.5-cm diameter 3.7% (2.65 kg).

abstract = {Angiosperm hydraulic performance is crucially affected by the diameters of vessels, the water conducting conduits in the wood. Hydraulic optimality models suggest that vessels should widen predictably from stem tip to base, buffering hydrodynamic resistance accruing as stems, and therefore conductive path, increase in length. Data from 257 species (609 samples) show that vessels widen as predicted with distance from the stem apex across angiosperm orders, habits and habitats. Standardising for stem length, vessels are only slightly wider in warm/moist climates and in lianas, showing that, rather than climate or habit, plant size is by far the main driver of global variation in mean vessel diameter. Terminal twig vessels become wider as plant height increases, while vessel density decreases slightly less than expected tip to base. These patterns lead to testable predictions regarding evolutionary strategies allowing plants to minimise carbon costs per unit leaf area even as height increases.},

abstract = {Implicit in the relationship between vegetation patterns and landforms is the influence of topography on the water regime at the patch scale. Hence, based on the numerous process-based studies linking plant structure and function to water in the arctic, we hypothesize that the general pattern of arctic landscapes can be explained by a mesotopographic variable such as water drainage. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by examining the spatial relationship between patterns of vegetation and the water regime in a small watershed in northern Alaska. Using gridded elevation data, we develop a model (T-HYDRO) to generate a 2-dimensional water flow field for the watershed and compare this to vegetation patterns as given by 1) a vegetation map developed from aerial photographs in conjunction with extensive field sampling; and 2) a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our results show that it is possible to account for about 43% of the spatial variance in NDVI, which supports our hypothesis. In spite of its limitations, the correspondence of patterns presented in this paper provides encouraging evidence that we can find simple approaches to stratify landscapes and that it is possible to overcome the frequently made assumption of spatial homogeneity in ecosystems modeling.},

In plants limited by nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), photosynthates are converted into sugars and secondary metabolites. Some surplus C is translocated to roots and released as root exudates or transferred to root-associated microorganisms. Surplus C is also produced under low moisture availability, low temperature, and high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with similar below-ground effects. Many interactions among above- and below-ground ecosystem components can be parsimoniously explained by the production, distribution, and release of surplus C under conditions that limit plant growth.},

abstract = {Gap models are flexible tools for the simulation of forest dynamics under different climatic conditions. An important area, however, has not yet received the attention it deserves: the formulation of height growth and maximum tree height. In most gap models, every tree approaches a fixed maximum height regardless of site conditions, and tree height as such is approximated via stem diameter. To address these issues, we converted maximum height from a parameter to a variable that depends on site-specific climatic conditions. We also established tree height as a separate state variable besides diameter, to allow for competition effects to influence the ratio between height and diameter growth. The new model formulations were tested against data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) and from a forest growth and yield research plot. Lastly the new model version was applied to study productivity changes due to climate change along an environmental gradient.The new model formulations increased the accuracy of simulations of stand characteristics without negatively influencing the general applicability of the model. The height/diameter relationship of a Douglas-fir stand in Switzerland simulated with the new model version resembled measurements closely, and biomass simulated along an environmental gradient agreed better with measurements (NFI) when using the new model version. Simulations with site-specific maximum height showed that the maximum heights of the dominant species on the gradient did not differ significantly from NFI data, whereas static maximum heights did.The application of the old and new model versions to simulate productivity under climatic change along the same environmental gradient showed that the conversion of a static parameter such as maximum height to a site-specific variable is not only a desirable, but a crucial feature to incorporate, since climate-induced changes in productivity are simulated to be more pronounced with the new model formulation. We conclude that dynamic height growth and site-specific maximum tree height can significantly improve simulation results of forest succession models, especially with regard to forest management under climate change. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Nonstructural carbohydrate reserves support tree metabolism and growth when current photosynthates are insufficient, offering resilience in times of stress. We monitored stemwood nonstructural carbohydrate (starch and sugars) concentrations of the dominant tree species at three sites in the northeastern United States. We estimated the mean age of the starch and sugars in a subset of trees using the radiocarbon ((14) C) bomb spike. With these data, we then tested different carbon (C) allocation schemes in a process-based model of forest C cycling. We found that the nonstructural carbohydrates are both highly dynamic and about a decade old. Seasonal dynamics in starch (two to four times higher in the growing season, lower in the dormant season) mirrored those of sugars. Radiocarbon-based estimates indicated that the mean age of the starch and sugars in red maple (Acer rubrum) was 7-14 yr. A two-pool (fast and slow cycling reserves) model structure gave reasonable estimates of the size and mean residence time of the total NSC pool, and greatly improved model predictions of interannual variability in woody biomass increment, compared with zero- or one-pool structures used in the majority of existing models. This highlights the importance of nonstructural carbohydrates in the context of forest ecosystem carbon cycling.},

abstract = {Leaves are extraordinarily variable in form, longevity, venation ar-chitecture, and capacity for photosynthetic gas exchange. Much of this diversity is linked with water transport capacity. The pathways through the leaf constitute a substantial (≥30%) part of the resistance to water flow through plants, and thus influence rates of transpiration and photosynthesis. Leaf hydraulic conductance (K leaf) varies more than 65-fold across species, reflecting differences in the anatomy of the petiole and the venation architecture, as well as pathways beyond the xylem through living tissues to sites of evaporation. K leaf is highly dynamic over a range of time scales, showing circadian and develop-mental trajectories, and responds rapidly, often reversibly, to changes in temperature, irradiance, and water supply. This review addresses how leaf structure and physiology influence K leaf , and the mecha-nisms by which K leaf contributes to dynamic functional responses at the level of both individual leaves and the whole plant.},

abstract = {Plant vascular networks are central to botanical form, function, and diversity. Here, we develop a theory for plant network scaling that is based on optimal space filling by the vascular system along with trade-offs between hydraulic safety and efficiency. Including these evolutionary drivers leads to predictions for sap flow, the taper of the radii of xylem conduits from trunk to terminal twig, and how the frequency of xylem conduits varies with conduit radius. To test our predictions, we use comprehensive empirical measurements of maple, oak, and pine trees and complementary literature data that we obtained for a wide range of tree species. This robust intra- and interspecific assessment of our botanical network model indicates that the central tendency of observed scaling properties supports our predictions much better than the West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) or pipe models. Consequently, our model is a more accurate description of vascular architecture than what is given by existing network models and should be used as a baseline to understand and to predict the scaling of individual plants to whole forests. In addition, our model is flexible enough to allow the quantification of species variation around rules for network design. These results suggest that the evolutionary drivers that we propose have been fundamental in determining how physiological processes scale within and across plant species.},

The study sites varied in initial density and tree size. The main canopy in all stands was even-aged. The ponderosa pine/Douglas fir and Sierra Nevada mixed conifer stand had younger age classes of Douglas fir or white fir in the understorey, as reflected in their estimated vertical fuel profiles. The stands without an understorey - lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir - had bell-shaped vertical distributions of available canopy fuels. The stands with an understorey - Sierra Nevada mixed conifer and ponderosa pine/Douglas fir - had canopy fuel under the main canopy. Based on allometric equations, the highest available canopy fuel load and highest bulk density was in the ponderosa pine stand.},

abstract = {I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. References Summary Climate change exposes vegetation to unusual drought, causing declines in productivity and increased mortality. Drought responses are hard to anticipate because canopy transpiration and diffusive conductance (G) respond to drying soil and vapor pressure deficit (D) in complex ways. A growing database of hydraulic traits, combined with a parsimonious theory of tree water transport and its regulation, may improve predictions of at-risk vegetation. The theory uses the physics of flow through soil and xylem to quantify how canopy water supply declines with drought and ceases by hydraulic failure. This transpiration ‘supply function' is used to predict a water ‘loss function' by assuming that stomatal regulation exploits transport capacity while avoiding failure. Supply–loss theory incorporates root distribution, hydraulic redistribution, cavitation vulnerability, and cavitation reversal. The theory efficiently defines stomatal responses to D, drying soil, and hydraulic vulnerability. Driving the theory with climate predicts drought-induced loss of plant hydraulic conductance (k), canopy G, carbon assimilation, and productivity. Data lead to the ‘chronic stress hypothesis' wherein > 60% loss of k increases mortality by multiple mechanisms. Supply–loss theory predicts the climatic conditions that push vegetation over this risk threshold. The theory's simplicity and predictive power encourage testing and application in large-scale modeling.},

abstract = {Ecosystem models have difficulty predicting plant drought responses, partially from uncer-tainty in the stomatal response to water deficits in soil and atmosphere. We evaluate a 'sup-ply–demand' theory for water-limited stomatal behavior that avoids the typical scaffold of empirical response functions. The premise is that canopy water demand is regulated in pro-portion to threat to supply posed by xylem cavitation and soil drying. The theory was implemented in a trait-based soil–plant–atmosphere model. The model pre-dicted canopy transpiration (E), canopy diffusive conductance (G), and canopy xylem pressure (P canopy) from soil water potential (P soil) and vapor pressure deficit (D). Modeled responses to D and P soil were consistent with empirical response functions, but controlling parameters were hydraulic traits rather than coefficients. Maximum hydraulic and diffusive conductances and vulnerability to loss in hydraulic conductance dictated stomatal sensitivity and hence the iso-to anisohydric spectrum of regulation. The model matched wide fluctuations in G and P canopy across nine data sets from seasonally dry tropical forest and pi$\sim$ non–juniper woodland with < 26% mean error. Promising initial performance suggests the theory could be useful in improving ecosystem models. Better understanding of the variation in hydraulic properties along the root–stem–leaf continuum will simplify parameterization.},

abstract = {Senescence of vascular tissue is critical in shaping woody stem structure and function. Parenchyma cells drive this process through a dramatic shift in function near the end of their life. In the past, heartwood formation was viewed as an aging process in which a gradual loss of metabolic activity led to cell death, but it is now clear that it defines an active program of tissue senescence. Carbohydrate stores are consumed, a suite of plant defense compounds are produced, and occlusions in the conducting elements render the tissue impermeable. A tree can thus regulate the amount of sapwood by continually, and safely, compartmentalizing nonfunctional xylem toward the center of the stem. Future work in this area should seek to link parenchyma physiology with the better-studied water transport properties of xylem, and consider the role of both axial and ray parenchyma in the exchange of material with the transpiration stream. One important area is the decoupling of water transport and carbohydrate storage functions in sapwood, and the extent to which parenchyma cell death is linked to cavitation. A better understanding is needed of how the loss of conductive function in xylem occurs with age, and how this process differs across species. Conifers and diffuse-porous species may prove particularly interesting because their sapwood remains conductive for many years, and it is not known if the reduced flow in the inner sapwood is due to cumulative and diffuse dysfunction or simply reduced pressure gradients driving flow. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A range of continental-scale soil datasets exists in Europe with different spatial representation and based on different principles. We developed comprehensive pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for applications principally on spatial datasets with continental coverage. The PTF development included the prediction of soil water retention at various matric potentials and prediction of parameters to characterize soil moisture retention and the hydraulic conductivity curve (MRC and HCC) of European soils. We developed PTFs with a hierarchical approach, determined by the input requirements. The PTFs were derived by using three statistical methods: (i) linear regression where there were quantitative input variables, (ii) a regression tree for qualitative, quantitative and mixed types of information and (iii) mean statistics of developer-defined soil groups (class PTF) when only qualitative input parameters were available. Data of the recently established European Hydropedological Data Inventory (EU-HYDI), which holds the most comprehensive geographical and thematic coverage of hydro-pedological data in Europe, were used to train and test the PTFs. The applied modelling techniques and the EU-HYDI allowed the development of hydraulic PTFs that are more reliable and applicable for a greater variety of input parameters than those previously available for Europe. Therefore the new set of PTFs offers tailored advanced tools for a wide range of applications in the continent.},

abstract = {Water-storage capacity was measured in Thuja occidentalis L., Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr., and Acer saccharum Marsh. during the dehydration of stem segments 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter. Stem water potential was measured with a temperature-corrected stem hygrometer and cavitations were detected acoustically. Water loss was measured by weight change. Dehydration isotherms consistently displayed three phases. The first phase, from water potential ($\Psi$) 0 to about -0.2 MPa, had a high capacitance (C>0.4kg water lost{\textperiodcentered} (1 of tissue)-1{\textperiodcentered} MPa-1) and we have attributed this high C to capillary water as defined by Zimmermann (1983, Xylem structure and the ascent of sap, Springer-Verlag). The second phase from $\Psi$=-0.5 to about -2.0 had the lowest C values (<0.02 kg{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}MPa-1) and was accompanied by a few cavitation events. This phase may have been a transition zone between capillary storage and water released by cavitation events as well as water drawn from living cells of the bark. The third phase also had a high C (about 0.07-0.22kg{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}MPa-1) and was associated with many cavitation events while $\Psi$ declined below about -2.5 MPa; we presume the high capacitance was the consequence of water released by cavitation events. We discuss the ecological adaptive advantage of these three phases of water-storage in trees. In moist environments, water withdrawn from capillary storage may be an important fraction of transpiration, but may be of little adaptive advantage. For most of the growth season trees draw mainly on elastic storage, but stem elastic storage is less than leaf elastic storage and therefore unlikely to be important. In very dry environments, water relased by cavitation events might be important to the short-term survival of trees. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We derive an analytic expression for the matric flux potential (M)\nfor van Genuchten&#8211;Mualem (VGM) type soils which can also be\nwritten in terms of a converging infinite series. Considering the\nfirst four terms of this series, the accuracy of the approximation\nwas verified by comparing it to values of M estimated by numerical\nfinite difference integration. Using values of the parameters for\nthree soils from different texture classes, the proposed four-term\napproximation showed an almost perfect match with the numerical solution,\nexcept for effective saturations higher than 0.9. Including more\nterms reduced the discrepancy but also increased the complexity of\nthe equation. The four-term equation can be used for most applications.\nCases with special interest in nearly saturated soils should include\nmore terms from the infinite series. A transpiration reduction function\nfor use with the VGM equations is derived by combining the derived\nexpression for M with a root water extraction model. The shape of\nthe resulting reduction function and its dependency on the derivative\nof the soil hydraulic diffusivity D with respect to the soil water\ncontent $\theta$ is discussed. Positive and negative values of dD/d$\theta$\nyield concave and convex or S-shaped reduction functions, respectively.\nOn the basis of three data sets, the hydraulic properties of virtually\nall soils yield concave reduction curves. Such curves based solely\non soil hydraulic properties do not account for the complex interactions\nbetween shoot growth, root growth, and water availability.},

@article{Walker2014,
abstract = {Great uncertainty exists in the global exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere. An important source of this uncertainty lies in the dependency of photosynthesis on the maximum rate of carboxylation (V cmax) and the maximum rate of electron transport (J max). Understanding and making accurate prediction of C fluxes thus requires accurate characterization of these rates and their relationship with plant nutrient status over large geographic scales. Plant nutrient status is indicated by the traits: leaf nitrogen (N), leaf phosphorus (P), and specific leaf area (SLA). Correlations between V cmax and J max and leaf nitrogen (N) are typically derived from local to global scales, while correlations with leaf phosphorus (P) and specific leaf area (SLA) have typically been derived at a local scale. Thus, there is no global-scale relationship between V cmax and J max and P or SLA limiting the ability of global-scale carbon flux models do not account for P or SLA. We gathered published data from 24 studies to reveal global relationships of V cmax and J max with leaf N, P, and SLA. V cmax was strongly related to leaf N, and increasing leaf P substantially increased the sensitivity of V cmax to leaf N. J max was strongly related to V cmax, and neither leaf N, P, or SLA had a substantial impact on the relationship. Although more data are needed to expand the applicability of the relationship, we show leaf P is a globally important determinant of photosynthetic rates. In a model of photosynthesis, we showed that at high leaf N (3 gm(-2)), increasing leaf P from 0.05 to 0.22 gm(-2) nearly doubled assimilation rates. Finally, we show that plants may employ a conservative strategy of J max to V cmax coordination that restricts photoinhibition when carboxylation is limiting at the expense of maximizing photosynthetic rates when light is limiting.},
