# (PART) Forest dynamics modelling {-}

# Forest dynamics model {#dynamicsmodelling}

This chapter provides an overview of a forest dynamics model, which builds on the previous models and allows simulating 

## Design principles


## State variables


## Process scheduling


## Inputs and outputs

### Soil, vegetation and meteorology

**Soil**

Soil input requirements are the same as for the basic water balance model and were fully described in section \@ref(soilinput). @Genuchten1980 water retention curves are forced for this model, because rhizosphere conductance is modelled using van Genuchten hydraulic equations (see subsection \@ref(vulnerabilitycurves)).

**Vegetation**

**Metereological input**

### Vegetation functional parameters

### Control parameters

Control parameters modulate the overall behaviour of growth simulations (see section \@ref(controlparameters)).

### Model output {#forestdynamicsoutput}

#### Annual output

#### Growth output


## Applications
