# (PART) Forest dynamics modelling {-}

# Forest dynamics model {#dynamicsmodelling}

This chapter provides an overview of a forest dynamics model, which builds on the previous models and allows simulating

## State variables


## Process scheduling


## Inputs and outputs

### Soil, vegetation and meteorology

**Soil**

Soil input requirements are the same as for the basic water balance model and were fully described in section \@ref(soilinput). @Genuchten1980 water retention curves are forced for this model, because rhizosphere conductance is modelled using van Genuchten hydraulic equations (see subsection \@ref(vulnerabilitycurves)).

**Vegetation**

**Metereological input**

### Vegetation functional parameters

### Control parameters

Control parameters modulate the overall behaviour of growth simulations (see section \@ref(controlparameters)).

### Model output {#forestdynamicsoutput}

#### Annual output


| Element | Description                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `StandSummary`| Stand-level summaries (leaf area index, tree basal area, tree density, shrub cover, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year. |
| `ForestStructures`| A list with the aboveground structure of the stand at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year. |
