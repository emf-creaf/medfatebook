### Temperature and turgor sink limitations

Sink limitations due to temperature and turgor effects on growth are modelled following @Cabon2019 and @Cabon2020. These authors suggested equations to model sink limitations on cambium cell division and tracheid expansion, but we apply the same approach for simulating growth of leaves, sapwood and fine roots. Cell relative expansion rate ($r_{cell}$) is central to the approach by Cabon et al. and is defined as the relative time derivative of cell volume:
\begin{equation}
r_{cell} = \frac{dV}{Vdt}
\end{equation}
@Cabon2019 first suggested to model the dependence of $r_{cell}$ on cell turgor using Lockhart's equation:
\begin{equation}
r_{cell}(\Psi, \pi_0) = \phi_{max} \cdot (\Psi - \pi_0  - Y_{P})
\end{equation}
where $\Psi$ is the water potential, $\pi_0$ is the osmotic water potential at full turgor and $Y_P = 0.05$ MPa is the turgor yield threshold. Later, @Cabon2020 suggested to account for both turgor and temperature limitations on $r_{cell}$ using the following expanded equation:
\begin{equation}
r_{cell}(T, \Psi, \pi_0) = \phi_{max} \cdot (\Psi - \pi_0  - Y_{P}) \cdot \frac{f_{met}(T_K)}{f_{met}(288.15)} \cdot{f_{micro}(T, T_{thr})}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is temperature, $f_{met}(T_K)$ is a function modulating the effect of temperature $T_K$ in Kelvin, on metabolic rate, and $f_{micro}(T, T_{thr})$ is a sigmoidal function modulating the effect of temperature on microtubule stability, depending on a temperature threshold $T_{thr}=5$ ÂºC. 
Function  $f_{met}(T_K)$ is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
f_{met}(T_K) = \frac{T_K \cdot \exp \big\{ \frac{\Delta H_A}{R^n \cdot T_K}\big\}}{1 + \exp \big\{ \frac{\Delta S_D}{R^n} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\Delta H_D}{\Delta S_D \cdot T_K} \right)\big\}}
\end{equation}
where $R^n$ is the ideal gas constant, $\Delta H_A = 87500$ the enthalpy of activation and $\Delta H_D = 333000$ and $\Delta S_D = 1090$ the enthalpy and entropy difference (respectively) between the catalytically active and inactive states of the enzymatic system). 

### Leaf growth

Leaf area increment $\Delta LA$ only occurs when phenological state is *unfolding*, and is defined as the minimum of three values expressing three corresponding constraints:
\begin{equation}
\Delta LA = \min( \Delta LA_{alloc}, \Delta LA_{source}, \Delta LA_{sink})
\end{equation}
First, $\Delta LA_{alloc}$ is the maximum leaf area increment allowed by the leaf area target set by the allocation rule, $LA^{target}$ in comparison with current leaf area $LA^{live}$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta LA_{alloc} = \max(LA^{target} - LA^{live},0)
\end{equation}
Remember that leaf area target is updated during *bud formation* (which occurred the year before in the case of deciduous plants). 

Second, $\Delta LA_{source}$ represents the leaf area increment expected given carbon source limitations and is calculated:
\begin{equation}
\Delta LA_{source} = \frac{\max(SS_{leaf}-SS_{leaf,growth},0)\cdot m_{gluc}\cdot V_{storage,leaf}}{1000 \cdot CC_{leaf} / SLA}
\end{equation}
where $SS_{leaf}$ is the current concentration of metabolic sugar, $SS_{leaf,growth}$ is the minimum concentration required for growth (specified in control vector `minimumSugarForGrowth`), $V_{storage,leaf}$ is the leaf storage volume, $m_{gluc}$ is glucose molar mass and the denominator contains the construction costs per leaf area unit, see eq. \@ref(eq:leafconstructioncost).

Finally, $\Delta LA_{sink}$ represents the leaf area increment expected by taking into account maximum leaf tissue growth rate ($RGR_{leaf, max}$; in $m^2 \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot day^{-1}$) relative to sapwood area $SA$ (in $cm^2$)  and the relative cell expansion rate given $T_{day}$, $\Psi_{symp,leaf}$ and $\pi_{0,leaf}$: 
\begin{equation}
\Delta LA_{sink} = SA \cdot RGR_{leaf, max} \cdot \frac{r_{cell}(T_{day}, \Psi_{leaf}, \pi_{0,leaf})}{r_{cell,max}}
\end{equation}
cell relative expansion rate is divided by the maximum relative cell expansion rate $r_{cell,max} = r_{cell}(25, 0, -2)$ so that $RGR_{leaf, max}$ is attained when sink conditions are optimal.

### Sapwood growth

### Fine root growth

Fine root growth is only modelled when simulating growth with the advanced water balance submodel (when using the basic water balance submodel fine root respiration costs are proportional to leaf respiration costs). 

Fine root biomass increment is modelled for each soil layer separately, and is defined analogously to leaf area increment: 
\begin{equation}
\Delta B_{fineroot} = \min( \Delta B_{fineroot,alloc}, \Delta B_{fineroot,source}, \Delta B_{fineroot,sink})
\end{equation}
First, $\Delta B_{fineroot,alloc}$ is the maximum fine root biomass increment allowed by the biomass target set by the allocation rule, $B_{fineroot,target}$ in comparison with current biomass, $B_{fineroot}$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta B_{fineroot,alloc} = \max(B_{fineroot,target} - B_{fineroot},0)
\end{equation}

Second, $\Delta B_{fineroot,source}$ represents the biomass increment expected given carbon source limitations and is calculated:
\begin{equation}
\Delta B_{fineroot,source} = \frac{\max(SS_{sapwood}-SS_{fineroot,growth},0)\cdot m_{gluc}\cdot V_{storage,sapwood}}{CC_{fineroot}}
\end{equation}
where $SS_{sapwood}$ is the current sapwood concentration of metabolic sugar, $SS_{fineroot,growth}$ is the minimum concentration required for fine root growth (specified in control vector `minimumSugarForGrowth`), $V_{storage,sapwood}$ is the sapwood storage volume, $m_{gluc}$ is glucose molar mass and $CC_{fineroot}$ is the construction costs per fine root biomass unit.

Finally, $\Delta B_{fineroot,sink}$ represents the biomass increment expected by taking into account maximum  tissue growth rate ($RGR_{fineroot, max}$; in $g\,dry \cdot g\,dry^{-1} \cdot day^{-1}$) and the relative cell expansion rate given temperature ($T_{day}$), water potential in the rhizosphere ($\Psi_{rhizo,s}$) and the stem osmotic potential at full turgor($\pi_{0,stem}$): 
\begin{equation}
\Delta B_{fineroot,sink} = B_{fineroot} \cdot RGR_{fineroot, max} \cdot \frac{r_{cell}(T_{day}, \Psi_{rhizo,s}, \pi_{0,stem})}{r_{cell,max}}
\end{equation}
cell relative expansion rate is divided by the maximum relative cell expansion rate $r_{cell,max} = r_{cell}(25, 0, -2)$ so that $RGR_{fineroot, max}$ is attained when sink conditions are optimal.


## Senescence

### Leaf senescence


During drought-periods (i.e. if $f_{turgor}(\Psi_{leaf})=0$) cavitation may occur. However, cavitation is applied at the leaf area level and not at the sapwood area level. During drought periods reductions of live leaf area can come from either sapwood conversion into heartwood or cavitation. First, the model compares the current $\Psi_{leaf}$ value with $\Psi_{\min}$ the minimum potential experienced since drought started:
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\min} = \min(\Psi_{leaf}, \, \Psi_{\min})
\end{equation}
Then the model determines the proportion of embolized conducts as the complement of hydraulic conductance corresponding to $\Psi_{\min}$, relative to the maximum hydraulic conductance. If the transpiration mode is "Simple", this is done using a whole-plant conductance function:
\begin{equation}
P_{embolism}=1- K(\Psi_{\min}) = \exp \left \{\ln{(0.5)}\cdot \left[ \frac{\Psi_{\min}}{\Psi_{extract}} \right] ^r \right \} 
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_{extract}$ is the potential at which conductance is 50% of maximum and $r=3$. If the transpiration mode is "Complex", $P_{embolism}$ is calculated using the stem-leaves vulnerability curve:
\begin{equation}
P_{emb}= 1- \frac{k_{stem}(\Psi_{\min})}{k_{stem}(0)} = 1 - \exp \left \{-\left[ \frac{\Psi_{\min}}{d_{stem}} \right] ^{c_{stem}} \right \} 
\end{equation}
Since leaf area reduction may also come from sapwood conversion into heartwood, the model determines which process leads to a larger reduction in leaf area:
\begin{equation}
LAI^{live} = \min(LAI^{live} - N \cdot \Delta SA_{turnover} \cdot Hv , \, LAI^{predrought} \cdot (1 - P_{emb}))
\end{equation}
and expanded leaf area ($LAI^{\phi}$) and dead leaf area ($LAI^{dead}$) are modified accordingly. 


### Sapwood senescence

@Prentice1993 assumed a constant annual rate of 4% for the conversion from sapwood to heartwood. Similarly, @Sitch2003 assumed a sapwood annual turnover rate of 5% for all biomes. A reasonable value for maximum daily turnover rate would be (assuming an annual rate 4.5%):
\begin{equation}
1-0.955^{(1/365)} = 0.0001261398
\end{equation}
The actual proportion of sapwood area that is transformed into heartwood is:
\begin{equation}
p_{heartwood} = \frac{0.0001261398}{1+15\cdot e^{-0.01\cdot H}}
\end{equation}
where 0.01 is a constant causing short plants to have slower turnover rates. 

Sapwood turnover is applied at the same rate in evergreen and deciduous species. The amount of sapwood that is converted to heartwood every day, $\Delta SA_{turnover}$, is thus:
\begin{equation}
\Delta SA_{turnover} = SA \cdot p_{heartwood}
\end{equation}
Before applying either growth or cavitation the model determines the extent to which cell turgor allows growth using a negative exponential function: 
\begin{equation}
f_{turgor}(\Psi_{leaf}) = 1 - \left[e^{(\Psi_{leaf}/\Psi_{tlp})-1}\right]^5
\end{equation}
where $f_{turgor}(\Psi_{leaf})=0$ if $\Psi_{leaf} > \Psi_{tlp}$. The following figure illustrates the function for $\Psi_{tlp}=-1.5$ MPa:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, fig.align='center'}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
psi = seq(0,3, by = 0.1)
f_turg = pmax(0, 1 - exp((psi/1.5) - 1)^5)
plot(psi, f_turg, xlab = "Leaf water potential (-MPa)", ylab = "Turgor function", type="l", ylim=c(0,1))
```

If $f_{turgor}(\Psi_{leaf})>0$ growth is applied, but there can be leaf area losses from sapwood turnover, whereas if $f_{turgor}(\Psi_{leaf}) = 0$ growth does not occur and cavitation is possible. The following two subsection detail the behavior of the growth model in each case.

### Fine root senescence

## Update of maximum stem conductance
The inclusion of $Hv$ in the initialization of $SA$ and in growth equations causes sapwood area and leaf area to maintain a constant ratio equal to $Hv$. However, this rule may be broken by leaf phenology or when losing leaves because of drought stress. Leaf area reductions cause transpirational demand to be reduced accordingly. Moreover, in the case of Complex's transpiration mode leaf loss causes variations in leaf area to sapwood area ratio, which may become lower than $Hv$ and, hence, maximum stem hydraulic conductance may increase. Tree size controls much of the variation in stem hydraulic conductance, since hydraulic path length increases with tree height. We modelled stem conductance per leaf area unit ($k_{stem, \max}$; in $mmolÂ·m^{-2}Â·s^{-1}Â·MPa^{-1}$) as a function of species-specific xylem conductivity ($k_{xylem, \max}$; in $kgÂ·m^{-1}Â·s^{-1}Â·MPa^{-1}$), leaf area to sapwood area ratio and tree height [@Christoffersen2016]:
\begin{equation}
k_{stem, \max} = \frac{1000}{0.018} \cdot \frac{k_{xylem, \max} \cdot (SA/10000)}{(H/100) \cdot LA^{\phi}} \cdot \chi_{taper}
\end{equation}
where $\chi_{taper}$ is a factor to account for taper of xylem conduit with height [@Savage2010; @Christoffersen2016], 0.018 is the molar weight of water (in kgÂ·mol$^{-1}$). This way, if the leaf-to-sapwood area ratio decreases with tree height, as has been documented in several species (McDowell et al. 2002), the decreasing conductance effects with height may be partially overcome [@Christoffersen2016]. A drought-induced decrease in $LA^{\phi}$ alleviate drought effects (i.e. a lower decrease in water potential across the stem for the same flow) because of an increase in conductance.
