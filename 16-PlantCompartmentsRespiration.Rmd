# Carbon pools and components of carbon balance

## Estimation of carbon pools {#estimationcarbonpools}

Biomass of leaves, sapwood and fine roots is needed in the model to estimate respiratory costs and the size of the C storage pools. 

### Leaf structural, metabolic and storage biomass

The live leaf area $LA^{live}$ per individual (in $m^2$) is:
\begin{equation}
LA^{live} = 10000 \cdot LAI^{live} / N
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the density of the cohort and $LAI^{live}$ is the leaf area index. Structural leaf biomass per individual ($B^{ind}_{leaf}$; $g\,dry·ind^{-1}$) is the result of dividing live leaf area by $SLA$ ($m^{2} \cdot kg^{-1}$), the specific leaf area of the species:
\begin{equation}
B^{ind}_{leaf} = 1000 \cdot LA^{live} / SLA
\end{equation}
where a factor 1000 is used to convert from kg to g. Hence, only expanded leaf area has respiratory cost (i.e. winter resistance buds do not). Leaf volume for an individual ($V^{ind}_{leaf}$; in $l$) is:
\begin{equation}
V^{ind}_{leaf} = LA^{live}  \cdot V_{leaf}
\end{equation}
where $V_{leaf}$ is the water storage capacity of leaf tissue per leaf area unit (in $l\cdot m^{-2}$) (see \@ref(plantwaterstoragecapacity)). Leaf volume is necessary to estimate the biomass of metabolic (sugars) or storage (starch) from the concentration of these substances in leaves ($SS_{leaf}$ and $ST_{leaf}$, which are expressed in $mol\,gluc \cdot L^{-1}$), and conversely. To estimate leaf storage capacity, the model assumes that up to 10\% of leaf tissue volume can be occupied with starch, so that the leaf starch storage capacity ($ST^{max}_{leaf}$; in $mol \cdot ind^{-1}$) is:
\begin{equation}
ST^{max}_{leaf} = 0.1 \cdot 1000 \cdot \frac{V^{ind}_{leaf} \cdot \rho_{starch}}{m_{starch}}
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{starch}$ is the density of starch and $m_{starch}$ is its molar mass.

### Sapwood structural, metabolic and storage biomass

Sapwood volume ($V_{stem}$; in $L \cdot ind^{-1}$) is defined as the product of sapwood area and the sum of aboveground height and belowground coarse root length:
\begin{equation}
V_{stem} = 1000 \cdot SA\cdot (H + \sum_{s}{FRP_s \cdot L_s})
\end{equation}
where $SA$ is sapwood area, $H$ is plant height, $FRP_{s}$ is the proportion of fine roots in soil layer $s$ and $L_{s}$ is the coarse root length in layer $s$ (all lengths expressed here in $m$). Sapwood structural biomass per individual ($B_{stem}$; $g\,dry·ind^{-1}$) represents the sapwood biomass of stems (including trunks and branches) and coarse roots. It is defined as the product of $V_{stem}$ and wood density  ($\rho_{wood}$; $g dry·cm^{-3}$):
\begin{equation}
B_{stem} = 1000 \cdot V_{stem} \cdot\rho_{wood}
\end{equation}
While $B_{stem}$ represents the structural biomass and can be used to estimate maintenance respiration costs (assuming empirical coefficients are determined for units of sapwood dry weight), the volume available for metabolic or storage carbon within sapwood is limited by wood porosity (i.e. $(1 - (\rho_{wood}/1.54))$) and the fact that sapwood contains vessels, which are dead cells. Sapwood storage volume ($V_{storage, stem}$; in $L \cdot ind^{-1}$) is:
\begin{equation}
V_{storage, stem} = V_{stem} \cdot (1 - (\rho_{wood}/1.54)) \cdot (1 - p_{vessels})
\end{equation}
where $p_{vessels} = 0.5$ is the proportion of vessels, assumed to be 50\% (hence 50\% of parenchymatic cells). Analogously to leaf carbon, $V_{storage, stem}$ is used to estimate the biomass of metabolic (sugars) or storage (starch) from the concentration of these substances in sapwood ($SS_{sapwood}$ and $ST_{sapwood}$, which are expressed in $mol\,gluc \cdot L^{-1}$), and conversely. To estimate sapwood storage capacity, the model assumes that up to 50\% of volume of parenchymatic cells can be occupied with starch, so that the sapwood starch storage capacity ($ST^{max}_{sapwood}$; in $mol \cdot ind^{-1}$) is:
\begin{equation}
ST^{max}_{sapwood} = 0.5 \cdot 1000 \cdot \frac{V_{sapwood,stem} \cdot \rho_{starch}}{m_{starch}}
\end{equation}

### Fine root structural biomass

The fine root compartment does not have labile carbon (i.e. the model supplies labile carbon for fine roots from sapwood compartment), so that only the structural biomass of fine roots needs to be estimated. If growth is simulated using the basic water balance model, the biomass of fine roots per individual ($B_{fineroot}$; $g\,dry·ind^{-1}$) is assumed half of biomass:
\begin{equation}
B_{fineroot} = B_{leaf}/2
\end{equation}
Hence, in this model fine-root maintenance respiration costs are also influenced by leaf-phenological status [@Sitch2003]. When growth is simulated using the advanced water balance model, fine root length per area in each soil layer ($FLA_s$; $m \cdot m^{-2}$) is estimated from rhizosphere conductance, assuming a cylindrical flow geometry in the rhizosphere. Then fine root biomass per individual ($g\,dry\cdot ind^{-1}$) is calculated using:
\begin{equation}
B_{fineroot} = \sum_{s}{\frac{10000\cdot FLA_s}{N\cdot 0.01 \cdot SRL}}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the density of individuals and $SRL$ ($cm \cdot g\,dry^{-1}$) is the specific root length.


## Components of carbon balance

### Gross photosynthesis

Among other outputs, the soil water balance submodel provides values of leaf water potential $\Psi_{leaf}$ (in MPa) and gross photosynthesis calculated at the plant cohort level, $A_g^{coh}$ (in $g C · m^{-2} · day^{-1}$).  $\Psi_{leaf}$ is used in the growth model to modulate drought effects on growth and leaf area losses (see below), whereas $A_g$ is needed to determine carbon balance and growth (note that the user output of function `spwb` and `pwb` refers to net photosynthesis after accounting for an estimate of leaf respiration). Since carbon balance is calculated at the individual level, $A_g^{coh}$ needs to be scaled to gross photosynthesis per individual (in $g C · ind^{-1} · day^{-1}$) using:
\begin{equation}
A_{g}^{ind} = 10000 \cdot A_g^{coh} / N
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the density of individuals per hectare.

### Maintenance respiration
Individual daily maintenance respiration ($R^{ind}$; in $g C·ind^{-1}$) is calculated for each of the three compartments (leaves, alive vascular tissues (stem and coarse roots), and fine roots) (Mouillot et al. 2001).  The model uses a $Q_{10}$ relationship with temperature, which means that for every 10ºC change in temperature there is a $Q_{10}$ factor change in respiration. Baseline respiration rates ($r_{leaf}$, $r_{stem}$ and $r_{root}$ for leaves, vascular tissues and fine roots, respectively; in $gC·gC^{-1}$) are not species-specific and all refer to 20ºC:
\begin{eqnarray}
R_{leaf} &=& B_{leaf} \cdot r_{leaf} \cdot Q_{10}^{(T_{mean}-20)/10} \\
R_{stem} &=& B_{stem} \cdot r_{stem} \cdot Q_{10}^{(T_{mean}-20)/10} \\
R_{root} &=& B_{root} \cdot r_{root} \cdot Q_{10}^{(T_{mean}-20)/10} \\
R^{ind} &=& R_{leaf}+R_{stem}+R_{root}
\end{eqnarray}
where $T_{mean}$ is the average daily temperature (in ºC). Note that the output of `growth()` regarding respiration is actually the result of scaling $R^{ind}$ to the cohort level ($R^{coh}$ in $g C · m^{-2} · day^{-1}$), for comparability with photosynthesis and transpiration:
\begin{equation}
R^{coh} =  R^{ind} \cdot N / 10000
\end{equation}
