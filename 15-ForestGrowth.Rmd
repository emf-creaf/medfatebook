# (PART) Forest growth modelling {-}

# Forest growth model {#growthmodelling}

Like the preceeding models, the physical structure of the stand is represented in one (vertical) dimension (i.e. the coordinates of plants are not explicit). The model is cohort-based, meaning that similar plant individuals are represented using a single entity with average properties (e.g. tree height or diameter) and a density variable is used to scale from individual level to the cohort level. Processes are implemented either at the cohort-level (water balance and photosynthesis) or at the individual level (carbon balance and growth). Water fluxes, soil water balance and plant photosynthesis processes follow the design of the soil water balance model and this part of the model design will not be repeated here. The model tries to reproduce the physiological processes that modulate leaf area changes and plant growth rates. Nevertheless, since the model does not implement all processes that may affect growth (such as nutrient availability), maximum growth rates and maximum plant sizes are constrained from user inputs, to ensure that model can be more easily calibrated and validated with observations. 

## Design principles (advanced water balance model)

### Carbon compartments, transport and carbon balance

Carbon pools are differentiated between **structural** and **labile**. Labile carbon involves two different pools (**metabolic** and **storage**) with a transfer rate between them [@Richardson2013; @Dietze2014], which we assume to be regulated by the need to maintain, as much as possible, a minimum amount of sugar carbon for metabolic and osmotic purposes. 

 + *Structural carbon* corresponds carbon forming cell membranes, cell walls and the cytosolic machinery. Structural carbon is used to calculate maintenance respiration and growth costs. Structural carbon occurs in three compartments: **leaves**, **sapwood** (stem, branches and coarse roots) and **fine roots**, which have different maintenance and growth costs. Structural carbon is lost when senescence occurs in each of these compartments.
 + *Metabolic carbon* is labile carbon assumed to correspond to sugars (glucose or fructose) that are used to sustain cell functioning (i.e. provide carbon for maintenance and growth). Metabolic carbon occurs in **leaves** and **sapwood**. Leaf metabolic carbon is generated from photosynthesis and used in different functions, including export to sapwood. Sugar concentration in the floem is assumed to be (passively) in equilibrium with leaf metabolic sugar concentration. In sapwood, metabolic carbon comes from floem transport and is used to sustain growth and maintenance respiration of sapwood and fine roots. Moreover, changes metabolic carbon are coupled to variations in osmotic potential. 
+ *Storage carbon* in the leaf is intented to represent short-term storage (mainly starch in chloroplasts) and its inclusion in the model follows the need to buffer daily variations in metabolic carbon as well as the corresponding leaf osmotic potential. Storage carbon in sapwood (branches, stems and coarse roots) is intended to serve as long-term (seasonal and interannual) storage.

Carbon balance of leaf labile (metabolic and storage) carbon is perfomed by considering photosynthesis, sugar-starch conversion and floem tranport. Growth and maintenance respiration is calculated at the individual level, by estimating the respiration of leaves, stem and fine root compartments. Stem respiration depends on sapwood area, stem height and root depth.

### Links between plant hydraulics and carbon balance

The model tries to coordinate carbon and water aspects of plant functioning by establishing several links between them (figure below):

 a. Transpiration and photosynthesis are coordinated via the stomatal regulation model.
 b. Leaf water potential of symplastic tissues determines turgor of leaf tissues for growth, while sugar concentration in the leaf tissues determines changes in osmotic potential at full turgor and hence, the relative water content of symplasmic storage.
 c. Analogously, water potential of stem symplastic tissues determines the turgor in the cambium and the sapwood formation rate, while the sugar concentration in the sapwood determines the osmotic potential at full turgor of stem symplastic tissues.
 d. Leaf growth and senescence influence hydraulic conductance of several tissues (fine roots, coarse root sapwood and stem sapwood) via changes in leaf area.
 e. Sapwood growth and senescence influence hydraulic conductance of coarse root and stem sapwood via changes in sapwood area.
 f. Fine root dynamics (should) influence fine root conductance and distribution across soil layers.

### Leaf area and sapwood area dynamics

Leaf area of each plant cohort is divided between live (wether in resistance buds or unfolded leaves) and dead (standing dead leaves). Expanded leaf area corresponds to the portion of live leaf area that is unfolded at any given moment through the leaf phenological cycle [this should change with a better treatment of phenology]. Leaf area increase by leaf growth and decreases by leaf senescense. 

Leaf senescence can occur due to leaf aging or due to a negative carbon balance in the leaf. Losts in sapwood area (i.e. conversion to heartwood) can occur via embolism or aging. Similarly to 3-PG [@Landsberg1997] we assume that the relative turnover rate of sapwood is smallest for young plants, and it increases up to a maximum value.

Growth is determined taking into account environmental limitations on both source (i.e. carbon assimilation) and sink (i.e. carbon investment on plant tissue expansion) [@Fatichi2014; @Guillemot2015; @Korner2015].

Ratios of leaf area to sapwood area (Huber value) can vary within species, due to environmental conditions [@Mencuccini1995]. Three options are possible regarding the relationship between leaf area and sapwood area (Huber values):

  1. *Constant Huber value*: Growth of leaf area and sapwood area need to be coordinated so that Huber value remains constant. Whole-plant conductance will decrease with the progressive increase in plant height. This is similar to the LPG model [@Sitch2003], where different turnover rates are applied for different tissues, but then tries to satisfy the pipe model [@Shinozaki1964] by allocating C where it is more limiting. 
  2. *Constant whole-plant conductance*: Growth of leaf area, sapwood area and height needs to be coordinated so that whole-plant conductance (excluding rhizosphere) is constant and equal to the initial value. Increases in daily leaf area or sapwood area are targetted depending on whether the current whole-plant conductance is above or below the target value.  
  3. *Emergent Huber value and whole-plant conductance*: Huber value variations arise as a result of the dynamic equilibrium of growth/senescence in leaf area and sapwood area, both constrained by plant hydraulics. Growth in leaves should be hiearchically prioritized (hormonal control?). An excess of leaf growth leds to a decrease in stem and root conductance (per leaf area), which may feedback negatively to leaf growth via a decreased leaf turgor. This can only be compensated by increasing again stem/root conductance via sapwood secondary growth. 

### Tree diameter, tree height and shrub cover updates

Tree structural variables are updated as in forest gap models [@Lindner1997].


## State variables

Some state variables are inherited by the corresponding water balance model (see  \@ref(statevariablesbasic) and \@ref(statevariablesadvanced)). 

Several structural variables that were static in the previous models become state variables here (for each cohort $i$):

 + Leaf area index of live leaves, $LAI^{live}_i$.
 + Diameter at breast height for trees, $DBH_i$.
 + Percent cover of shrubs, $Cover_i$.
 + Plant height, $H_i$.
 + Crown ratio, $CR_i$.
 + Maximum rooting depth, $Z_i$, and the proportion of fine roots, $V_{i,s}$, in each soil layer $s$.
 
 Finally, there are functional state variables necessary to know the fisiological status of plants, defined at the individual level:
 
 + Sapwood area, $SA_i$ (in $cm^2$).
 + Sugar storage in leaves, $SS_{leaf,i}$ (in $g C$).
 + Starch storage in leaves, $ST_{leaf,i}$ (in $g C$).
 + Sugar storage in sapwood (stem, branches and coarse roots), $SS_{sapwood,i}$ (in $g C$).
 + Starch storage in sapwood (stem, branches and coarse roots), $ST_{sapwood,i}$ (in $g C$).
 + Biomass of fine roots (in $g C$).
 
Note that other functional variables can be derived without the need to store them:

 + Leaf biomass (in $g C$) from $LAI^{live}$, $N$ and $SLA$.
 + Leaf volume (in $l$) from leaf biomass and density of leaf tissue.
 + Sapwood volume (in $l$) from $SA$, $H$ and $Z$.
 + Sapwood biomass (in $g C$) from sapwood volume and wood density.
 
## Carbon balances

Since the growth model builds on soil and plant water balances models, the water and energy balances explained in sections \@ref(soilwaterbalance) or \@ref(waterenergybalances) (depending on `transpirationMode`) also hold for this model.

The model performs daily carbon balance in leaves and sapwood (stem, branches and coarse roots) for each plant cohort. In each of these two compartments carbon balance is performed for the two storage forms, dissolved sugars and starch. At the leaf level, the carbon balance equations for dissolved sugars and starch are ($i$ subscripts ommited):

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta{SS_{leaf}} &=& A - R_{leaf} - F_{floem} - G_{leaf} - \Delta{ST_{leaf}}\\
\Delta{ST_{leaf}} &=& \Delta{t} \cdot [K_{synthesis}(SS_{leaf}) - K_{hydrolisis}(ST_{leaf})]
(\#eq:leafcarbonbalanceequations)
\end{eqnarray}
where $A$ is (gross) photosynthesis, $R_{leaf}$ is leaf respiration, $F_{floem}$ is the sugar flow via floem towards the stem and roots, $G_{leaf}$ is the carbon lost via new leaf growth and $\Delta{ST_{leaf}}$ is the change in leaf starch. $K_{synthesis}$ and $K_{hydrolisis}$ are the instantaneous kinetic rates of starch synthesis and hydrolisis, respectively. Leaf senescense has no impact on dissolved sugar and starch compartments of leaves (but it affects leaf biomass, volume and leaf area) as it is assumed that these non-structural carbon sources are recycled before necrosis.

The corresponding carbon balance equations for sapwood dissolved sugars and starch are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta{SS_{sapwood}} &=& F_{floem} - R_{sapwood} - R_{fineroots} - G_{sapwood} - G_{fineroots} \\
                     & & - \Delta{ST_{sapwood}} \\
\Delta{ST_{sapwood}} &=& \Delta{t} \cdot [K_{synthesis}(SS_{sapwood}) - K_{hydrolisis}(ST_{sapwood})]
(\#eq:sapwoodcarbonbalanceequations)
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{floem}$ is the sugar inflow via floem transport, $R_{sapwood}$ is the sum of respiration of branches, stem and coarse roots, $R_{fineroots}$ is the respiration of fine roots, $G_{sapwood}$ and $G_{fineroots}$ are the carbon expenses of growth of new sapwood tissue or fine roots (respectively). Analogously to leave senescense, when sapwood is converted into heartwood, non-structural carbon in the protoplasm of parenchyma cells is assumed to be absorbed by neighbouring living cells.

## Process scheduling

For every day to be simulated, the model first updates the expanded leaf area of living plants according to the phenology of species and the day of the year and performs soil water balance, transpiration and photosynthesis calculations by calling the water balance submodel (see \@ref(basicwaterbalancescheduling) and \@ref(advancedwaterbalancescheduling)). 

After dealing with water fluxes and photosynthesis, the model performs the following daily steps:

1. Determine the current amount of live structural biomass (in leaves, sapwood and fine root compartments), storage volume (in leaves and sapwood) and carbon construction costs per unit tissue (leaf or sapwood) area. 
2. For every **subdaily step** perform carbon balance as follows:
    a. Calculate gross photosynthesis per individual ($A$).
    b. Determine maintenance respiration costs for leaves ($R_{leaf}$), sapwood ($R_{sapwood}$) and fine roots ($R_{fineroot}$), taking into account both live structural biomass and labile sugar biomass.
    c. Evaluate temperature and turgor sink limitations for growth of leaves and sapwood. If leaf/sapwood growth is permitted, estimate growth costs ($G_{leaf}$ and $G_{sapwood}$) and record leaf/sapwood area increases. 
    d. Update $SS_{leaf}$ and $SS_{sapwood}$ taking into account photosynthesis, maintenance respiration and growth respiration.
    e. Evaluate floem transport ($F_{floem}$) and sugar-starch dynamics ($K_{synthesis}$ and $K_{hydrolisis}$) in the leaf and sapwood compartments **at 1s time steps**. This completes the carbon balance of $SS_{leaf}$ \@ref(eq:leafcarbonbalanceequations) and $SS_{sapwood}$ \@ref(eq:sapwoodcarbonbalanceequations) for the subdaily time step.
  
3. If the balance of $SS_{leaf}$ is negative, apply leaf senescense as the exceeding leaf area according to respiration costs. Otherwise, a constant leaf senescense rate is applied according to leaf lifespan. Leaf senescence does not affect leaf C storage.
4. Apply a constant rate of sapwood senescense (conversion to heartwood), which does not affect sapwood C storage.
5. Increase sapwood area ($SA$) and leaf area ($LAI^{live}$) according to cumulative increases obtained from carbon balance.
6. Update Huber values, hydraulic conductance of stems and roots according to current sapwood and leaf area values. 
7. Update osmotic potential at full turgor of leaves and sapwood according to current sugar concentrations (a constant concentration of salts is assumed).
8. If non-stomatal photosynthesis limitations are considered, apply them.

At the end of each year (and at the end of the simulated period) the model translates cumulated sapwood area growth into structural variables (i.e., plant height, tree DBH, tree crown ratio and shrub cover). 


## Inputs and outputs

### Soil, vegetation and meteorology

**Soil**

Soil input requirements are the same as for the basic water balance model and were fully described in section \@ref(soilinput). @Genuchten1980 water retention curves are forced for this model, because rhizosphere conductance is modelled using van Genuchten hydraulic equations (see subsection \@ref(vulnerabilitycurves)).

**Vegetation**

Vegetation input requirements were fully described in section \@ref(vegetationinput). Trees and shrubs do not need to be characterized with different variables in soil water balance calculations, since both kinds of cohort have a $LAI$ value. In most cases, users only need to estimate the leaf area index corresponding to live leaves, i.e. $LAI^{live}$, because normally at the starting point all leaves are expanded (i.e. $LAI^{\phi} = LAI^{live}$) and one can assume no dead leaves in the canopy (i.e., $LAI^{dead} = 0$). Vegetation characteristics stay constant during simulations using function `spwb()`, although the actual expanded leaf area ($LAI^{\phi}$) and dead leaf area may vary if the species is winter deciduous.

**Metereological input**

Weather input data must include variables calculated at the **daily** scale. The variables required by function `growth()` depend on the transpiration mode, similarly to function `spwb()`. We recommend meteorological input to be generated using package **meteoland** [@DeCaceres2018].

### Vegetation functional parameters

Vegetation in the stand is described using a set of plant cohorts, described in an object of class `growthInput`. This function assembles all parameters needed for the simulation of a given stand in a single list. Model parameters are grouped by category.  Regarding physical aboveground description of the stand, each plant cohort is defined by its species identity ($SP$; with R name [`SP`]). In addition, each cohort needs to be defined regarding the following state variables:

+ $N$ [`N`]: The density of individuals (in $ind · ha^{-1}$).
+ $DBH$ [`DBH`]: Tree diameter at breast height (in cm).
+ $Cover$ [`Cover`]: Shrub percent cover (in %).
+ $H$ [`H`]: Total tree or shrub height (in cm).}
+ $CR$ [`CR`]: Crown ratio (i.e. the ratio between crown length and total height).}
+ $LAI^{live}$ [`LAI_live`]: Live leaf area index (one-side live leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand) (in m$^2$·m$^{-2}$).}
+ $LAI^{\phi}$ [`LAI_expanded`]: Expanded leaf area index (one-side expanded leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand) (in m$^2$·m$^{-2}$).}
+ $LAI^{dead}$ [`LAI_dead`]: Dead leaf area index (one-side dead leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand) (in m$^2$·m$^{-2}$).}
+ $LAI^{predrought}$ [`LAI_predrought`]: Live leaf area index before the current drought started (one-side dead leaf area of plants in the cohort per surface area of the stand) (in m$^2$·m$^{-2}$).}
+ $SA$ [`SA`]: Area of functional sapwood per individual (in cm$^2$·ind$^{-1}$).}
+ $C_{fast}$ [`fastCstorage`]: Amount of C in the fast carbon storage pool (in g C·ind$^{-1}$).}
+ $C_{slow}$ [`slowCstorage`]: Amount of C in the slow carbon storage pool (in g C·ind$^{-1}$).}

Excepting $SP$ (species identity) and $N$ (density), the remaining aboveground state variables are modified during growth simulations. Belowground parameters are the following:

+ $Z$ [`Z`]: The rooting depth (in cm).}
+ $V$ [`V`]: A matrix with the proportion of fine roots in each soil layer.}

Additional belowground variables are included if `transpirationMode = "Complex"}. These, and the parameters needed for water balance calculations are described in vignette '\textbf{Soil description and root system architecture}'. 

The following physiological parameters are needed for growth calculations:

+ $SLA$ [`SLA`]: Specific leaf area (m$^2$·kg$^{-1}$).
+ $Hv$ [`Al2As`]: Huber value. Leaf area to sapwood area ratio (in m$^2$·m$^{-2}$).}
+ $W_{dens}$ [`WoodDens`]: Wood density (at 0\% humidity) (in g·cm$^{-3}$).}
+ $W_{C}$ [`WoodC`]: Wood carbon content in relation to dry weight (in g·g$^{-1}$).}
+ $C_{p,\max}$ [`Cstoragepmax`]: Maximum storage capacity, expressed as C per total respiratory C (in gC·gC$^{-1}$).
+ $RGR_{\max}$ [`RGRmax`]: Maximum daily relative growth rate (in sapwood area basis) (in cm$^2$·cm$^{-2}$).

Another set of parameters is needed to transform changes in sapwood area and leaf area to changes in the structural variables such as tree height, tree crown ratio or shrub cover:

+ $H_{\max}$ [`Hmax`]: Maximum plant height (in cm).
+ $f_{HD,\min}$, $f_{HD,\max}$ [`fHDmin}, `fHDmax`]: Minimum and maximum values of the height-diameter ratio (in cm·cm$^{-1}$).
+ $Z_{\max}$ [`Zmax`]: Maximum rooting depth (in mm).
+ $a_{ash}$ [`Aash`]: Regression coefficient for the quadratic relationship between shrub height and shrub area.
+ $a_{bsh}$, $b_{bsh}$ [`Absh`, `Bbsh`]: Allometric coefficients relating crown phytovolume with dry weight of shrub individuals.

+ $a_{cw}$, $b_{cw}$ [`Acw`, `Bcw`]: Regression coefficients used to calculate the crown width of trees (as intermediary step to obtain the crown ratio).
