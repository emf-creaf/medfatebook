# Transpiration, photosynthesis and drought stress under Granier's model {#transpirationgranier}

This chapter describes how daily plant transpiration is modelled in the basic water balance model, completing the flows needed to evaluate eq. \@ref(eq:basicwaterbalanceequation). The model uses the approach of BILJOU [@Granier1999] to estimate stand maximum transpiration, and then divides this value among the contribution of plant cohorts and estimate actual transpiration depending on soil moisture and cohort functional parameters, which determine plant drought. The chapter also describes how is daily photosynthesis estimated, a process that in this model does not influence transpiration but is necessary for growth calculations (chapter \@ref(growthmodelling)). 

## Plant transpiration and photosynthesis
### Maximum transpiration {#maximumtranspiration}

Potential evapotranspiration ($PET$, in mm) is assumed to represent open water evaporation potential. Maximum canopy transpiration $Tr_{\max}$ depends on both $PET$ and the amount of transpirating surface, i.e. the current cumulative $LAI$ of the stand, $LAI^{\phi}_{stand}$. To estimate $Tr_{\max}$ the model uses the empirical equation of @Granier1999, where $Tr_{\max}/PET$ is a function of $LAI^{\phi}_{stand}$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{Tr_{\max}}{PET}= -0.006\cdot (LAI^{\phi}_{stand})^2+0.134\cdot LAI^{\phi}_{stand}+0.036
\end{equation}
This equation has already been adopted for Mediterranean biomes [@Fyllas2009; @Ruffault2013].

plot(LAIc, TmaxPET, type="l", ylab="Tr_max/PET", xlab="LAIstand", ylim=c(0,1))
```

Since medfate's **ver. 2.1**, empirical coefficients can be species-specific and @Granier1999 empirical equation has been generalized to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{Tr_{\max}}{PET}=  T_{max,LAI} \cdot LAI^{\phi}_{stand} + T_{max,sqLAI} \cdot (LAI^{\phi}_{stand})^2 
\end{equation}
where $T_{max,LAI}$ and $T_{max,sqLAI}$ are species-specific parameters (if missing, they are given default values 0.134 and -0.006, respectively). 

The maximum transpiration for a given plant cohort $i$ is calculated using the portion of $Tr_{\max}$ defined by $f_i$ the fraction of total absorbed SWR that is due
to cohort $i$ (see section \@ref(basiclightextinction)):
\begin{equation}
Tr_{\max, i} = Tr_{\max} \cdot \frac{f_i^{0.75}}{\sum_{j}{f_j^{0.75}}}
\end{equation} 
Before **ver 2.5.0** $Tr_{\max, i}$ was linearly related to $f_i$, but an exponent 0.75 is now used to decrease *ad hoc* the proportion of transpiration corresponding to cohorts absorbing high SWR fractions with respect to those absorbing low amounts of SWR, which has been found to better match the transpiration predicted using the advanced transpiration model. Note that the actual amount of radiation energy absorbed by plants is much more difficult to determine, involving diffuse and direct radiation, as well as net long-wave radiation (see chapter \@ref(radiationbalance)). 

### Actual plant transpiration {#actualtranspiration}

Actual plant transpiration depends on soil moisture and is calculated for each plant cohort and each soil layer separately. $Tr_{i,s}$ (in mm) represents the transpiration made by cohort $i$ from layer $s$. Actual plant transpiration from a given layer is regulated by soil moisture and the resistance to water flow through the plant. For each plant cohort $i$ and soil layer $s$, the model first estimates the a whole-plant relative water transpiration, $K_{i,s}$, which varies between 0 and 1 depending on $\Psi_{extract,i}$, the potential at which transpiration is 50% of maximum, and $\Psi_s$, the water potential in layer $s$. This relationship is modelled using a Weibull function (see function `hydraulics_psi2K()`):
\begin{equation}
K_{i,s}=K_{i}(\Psi_s) = \exp \left \{\ln{(0.5)}\cdot \left[ \frac{\Psi_s}{\Psi_{extract,i}} \right] ^r \right \} 
(\#eq:relativewholeplantconductance)
\end{equation}
where $r$ is an exponent that modulates the steepness of the decrease in relative
conductance when soil potential becomes negative (by default, $r = 3$) and $\ln(0.5)$
is used to ensure that $K_{i}(\Psi_{extract,i}) = 0.5$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:wholeplantconductance)).

Until **ver 2.5.0**, actual transpiration of plant cohort $i$ from a given soil layer $s$, $Tr_{i,s}$, was defined as the product of [@Mouillot2001]: the maximum transpiration of the plant cohort ($Tr_{\max,i}$), the relative whole-plant transpiration ($K_{i,s}$) corresponding to the species and water potential in layer $s$, and the proportion of plant fine roots in layer $s$, $FRP_{i,s}$:
\begin{equation}
Tr_{i,s} =  Tr_{\max,i} \cdot K_{i,s} \cdot FRP_{i,s}
\end{equation}
Since **ver 2.5.0**, this equation has been slightly modified and is now:
\begin{equation}
Tr_{i,s} =  Tr_{\max,i} \cdot K_{i,s} \cdot \frac{K_{unsat,s}^{0.5} \cdot FRP_{i,s}}{\sum_r{K_{unsat,r}^{0.5} \cdot FRP_{i,r}}}
\end{equation}
where $K_{unsat,s}$ is the unsaturated soil conductivity of layer $s$. This modification was introduced to allow the plant to increase the amount of water drawn from layers with higher levels of moisture in seasons where the usual water pools are depleted. This formulation decreases the differences in soil moisture between soil layers, which in the advanced model is achieved thanks to hydraulic redistribution process.  

The total amount of water transpired by plants, $Tr$ (in mm), is the sum of $Tr_{i,s}$ values over all plant cohorts and soil layers:
\begin{equation}
Tr =\sum_{s}\sum_{i}{Tr_{i,s}}
\end{equation}
Assuming no water limitations (i.e. $K_{i,s} = 1$), we have that $Tr = Tr_{\max}$. Total stand transpiration will be lower than $Tr_{\max}$ if soil water potential in any layer is negative enough to cause a significant reduction in whole-plant conductance. At the plant level, the transpiration of a given plant cohort will be lower than that of others if: 

  a. The cohort is under the shade (it reduces $f_i$ and hence $Tr_{\max,i}$)
  b. The cohort has a lower amount of leaf area (it reduces $f_i$ and hence $Tr_{\max,i}$)
  c. The soil layers exploited by the cohort have more negative water potentials (it reduces $K_{i,s}$). 

### Transpiration with plant water pools {#transpirationpools}
Considering plant water pools (i.e. setting `plantWaterPools = TRUE` in the control parameters) involves partitioning the stand area into fractions corresponding to the abundance of each plant cohort. More specifically, the model defines as many plant water pools as plant cohorts, with proportions defined by their LAI values:
\begin{equation}
f_{pool,i} = \frac{LAI^{live}_i}{LAI^{live}_{stand}}
\end{equation}
Overall soil moisture is then related to moisture of plant water pools by the following equation, that is fulfilled for each soil layer $s$:
\begin{equation}
W_{s} = \sum_{i}{f_{pool,i} \cdot W_{i,s}}
\end{equation}
where $W_{i,s}$ is the soil moisture (relative to field capacity) of layer $s$ in the plant water pool of cohort $i$, i.e. under the area of the stand attributed to cohort $i$.

When transpiration occurs and plant water pools are considered, the model assumes that the rhizosphere of each plant cohort occupies its own water pool but may enter into the water pools under other plant cohorts. In other words, the root systems of different cohorts may overlap horizontally. A given plant cohort $i$ will have its roots in layer $s$ partitioned among different water pools. Let us assume that we know $fr_{i,s,j}$, the (horizontal) proportion of fine roots of cohort $i$ in layer $s$ of the water pool $j$ (see section \@ref(plantwaterpools)). These proportions fulfill:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j}{fr_{i,s,j}} = 1 \,\, \forall i,s
\end{equation}
The soil moisture *sensed* by plant cohort $i$ in layer $s$, $W_{rhizo,i,s}$ is a weighted sum of moisture in water pools, with weights being the proportion of fine roots in each pool:
\begin{equation}
W_{rhizo,i,s} = \sum_{j}{fr_{i,s,j} \cdot W_{i,s}}
\end{equation}
This moisture determines $\Psi_{s,i}$, the corresponding water potential, which replaces $\Psi_{s}$ in eq. \@ref(eq:relativewholeplantconductance), so that plant conductance depends on the soil moisture *sensed* by the rhizosphere of the plant cohort. If the (actual) transpiration of cohort $i$ from soil layer $s$ is $Tr_{i,s}$, the water extracted by transpiration from a water pool $j$ will be:
\begin{equation}
Tr_{i,s,j} = \frac{fr_{i,s,j} \cdot Tr_{i,s}}{f_{pool,j}}
\end{equation}
It is easy to verify that this definition ensures the fulfillment of an equation analogous to that between $W_{s}$ and $W_{s,i}$:
\begin{equation}
Tr_{i,s} = \sum_{j}{f_{pool,j} \cdot Tr_{i,s,j}}
\end{equation}

### Plant photosynthesis {#basicphotosynthesis}

Because it is useful for growth, and for compatibility with the 'Sperry' transpiration mode (chapter \@ref(advancedwaterbalance)), the water balance model using 'Granier' transpiration mode also calculates gross assimilated carbon. Assuming a constant maximum water use efficiency ($WUE_{\max}$), gross photosynthesis for a given plant cohort $i$ (in $g\,C \cdot m^{-2}$) is estimated as a function of transpiration:
\begin{equation}
A_{g,i} = Tr_i \cdot WUE_{\max,i} \cdot (L^{PAR}_i)^{WUE_{decay,i}}
\end{equation}
where $Tr_i$ is the transpiration of plant cohort $i$, $WUE_{\max,i}$ is the maximum water use efficiency of the cohort (in $g\,C \cdot mm^{-1}$) - a species-specific parameter where WUE assumed to be estimated under conditions of no water stress and maximum light availability -, $L^{PAR}_i$ is the proportion of photosynthetically-active radiation available at the mid-crown of cohort $i$, according to the Beer-Lambert extinction model, and $WUE_{decay,i}$ is a species-specific exponent indicating how relative WUE decreases with lower light levels. The dependency of photosynthesis on drought stress is represented in the $Tr_i$ term, whereas the reduction of photosynthesis due to low light availability (for cohorts in the understory) is represented by the reduction of relative WUE given by low values of $L^{PAR}_i$:

```{r WUErelationship, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between the percentage of PAR available to a cohort and the water use efficiency (left) or the water use efficiency relative to the maximum value observed in the stand for the same species (right). WUE values were estimated using the advanced water balance model and a non-linear regression was fitted.", echo=FALSE}

```


## Plant drought stress

### Daily drought stress and plant water potential {#dailystressbasicwater}

Similarly to @Mouillot2002, daily drought stress of a given plant cohort $i$, $DDS_i$, is defined as the complement of relative whole-plant transpiration and is aggregated across soil layers using the proportion of fine roots in each layer as weights:
\begin{equation}
DDS_i=\phi_i \cdot \sum_{s}{(1-K_{i,s})\cdot v_{i,s}}
\end{equation}
Leaf-phenological status is included to prevent winter deciduous plants from suffering drought stress during winter. Daily drought stress values can be later used to define drought stress indices for larger temporal scales, as presented in the main text.

Granier's transpiration model does not allow estimating a water potential drop from soil to the leaf. Moreover, in a multilayered soil it is difficult to know what would be the water potential of the plant. Despite these limitations, a gross surrogate of  'plant' water potential ($\Psi_{i}$; in MPa) may be obtained averaging whole-plant relative conductance values and inverting the relative transpiration function:
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{i}= K_i^{-1}\left(\sum_{s}{K_{i,s}\cdot v_{i,s}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $K_i^{-1}$ is the inverse of the relative whole-plant transpiration eq. \@ref(eq:relativewholeplantconductance) (see function `hydraulics_K2Psi()`). 
 
### Cavitation and hydraulic disconnection {#irreversiblecavitation}
The water balance model is normally run assuming that although soil drought may reduce transpiration, embolized xylem conduits are automatically refilled when soil moisture recovers (in other words, cavitation is reversible and `cavitationRefill = "total"`). It is possible to simulate irreversible cavitation by setting `cavitationRefill = "none"` or `cavitation = "annual"` in the control parameters. Any of these options cause the model to keep track of the maximum value of cavitation so far experienced using the proportion of of lost conductance for the plant cohort $i$ ($PLC_i$), which is modelled also using a Weibull function:
\begin{equation}
PLC_{i} = \max \left \{PLC_{i}, 1 - \exp \left \{ \ln{(0.5)}\cdot \left[ \frac{\Psi_i}{\Psi_{critic,i}} \right] ^r \right \} \right \} 
\end{equation}
and then $K_{i,s}$ cannot be larger than the one-complement of $PLC_i$:
\begin{equation}
K_{i,s} = \min \{K_{i}(\Psi_s), 1.0 - PLC_{i} \}
\end{equation}

For simulations of less than one year one can use `cavitationRefill = "none"` to keep track of the maximum cavitation. However, for simulations of several years, it is normally advisable to allow recovery. If `cavitation = "annual"`, $PLC_{i}$ values are set to zero at the beginning of each year, assuming that embolized plants overcome the conductance loss by creating new xylem tissue.

Another optional behavior consists in allowing the plant to disconnect from the soil when its potential becomes too negative. This may be advantageous for a cavitation-sensitive plant that is competing for water with another plant with higher extraction capacity. Parameter $K_{rootdisc,i}$ can be used to specify the minimum relative conductance value that the plant will tolerate without disconnecting hydraulically from the soil (by default $K_{rootdisc,i} = 0$). If, after possibly accounting for irreversible cavitation, $K_{i,s}<K_{rootdisc,i}$
for a given soil layer, then the model assumes that transpiration from this soil
layer is absent. Moreover, $K_{i,s}$ is assumed equal to $K_{rootdisc,i}$ for the
sake of determining plant water potential.
