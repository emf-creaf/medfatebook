# Advanced water balance model {#advancedwaterbalance}

This chapter provides an overview of a water and energy balance model, described in @DeCaceres2021, that shares some characteristics with the basic water balance model described in previous chapters. Like the previous one, the model is run using function `spwb()`, for a set of days, or function `spwb_day()`, for a single day. Compared to the basic model, the advanced water balance model adds more detail in some processes (light extinction, plant hydraulics and photosynthesis) and incorporates others that were missing (energy balances, plant water balance and hydraulic redistribution). 

The following overview is structured as in chapter \@ref(basicwaterbalance). Process formulations shared with the basic water balance model were presented in previous chapters and will not be repeated. The chapters following this one provide a detailed description of those submodules that are exclusive of the advanced model. We recommend readers to familiarize themselves with basic water balance modelling processes before reading this and the subsequent chapters. In addition, users of this model should have a background on the processes implemented to fully understand and exploit model outputs. Since the scope of this book is focused on the model, interested readers should address relevant ecophysiological bibliography complement the material exposed here.

## Design principles

The model performs soil/plant water balance and soil/canopy energy balance for a given forest stand and for the period corresponding to input weather data. Soil water balance is calculated on a daily step basis whereas energy balances and plant transpiration are determined at subdaily steps. The model considers only the vertical spatial dimension of the stand, and not the horizontal distribution of plants within it. Still, the forest stand is divided into: (a) canopy vertical layers; (b) plant cohorts of different species, height and leaf area index ($LAI$). 

Hydrological processes are the same as in chapter \@ref(basicwaterbalance), except for the addition of hydraulic redistribution of soil water via plant roots. The model includes water interception loss [@Gash1995], plant transpiration, evaporation from soil [@Ritchie1972] and the partition between infiltration and runoff [@Boughton1989]. Infiltration is partitioned among soil layers, depending on macroporosity, and water exceeding soil water holding capacity is lost via deep drainage. Snow pack dynamics can also be simulated.

A great deal of the complexity of the advanced model concerns the estimation of plant transpiration and photosynthesis. The model simulates stomatal regulation of gas exchange separately for sunlit and shade leaves at sub-daily steps, involving detailed calculations of hydraulics, leaf energy balance and photosynthesis [@Sperry2016]. Compared to the basic water balance model of chapter \@ref(basicwaterbalance), the higher level of complexity of the advanced model allows a more precise estimation of photosynthesis and transpiration. Moreover, the plant hydraulics submodel generates redistribution of water among soil layers.

To calculate radiation balance and incident PAR at the leaf level, the leaf area of each plant cohort is divided into vertical layers according to its crown limits. Photosynthesis and transpiration of sunlit and shade leaves are treated separatedly [@DePury1997]. Given an input direct and diffuse short-wave irradiance at the top of the canopy, the amount of light absorbed by sunlit leaves, shade leaves and the soil follows the model of @Anten2016. The scheme for long-wave radiation transfer between the atmosphere, the different canopy layers and the soil follows the SHAW model [@Flerchinger2009].

Energy balances are conducted at two levels: the canopy (or canopy layers) level and the leaf level. The model keeps track of temperature variation within the canopy (i.e. canopy energy balance) and in the uppermost soil surface (i.e. soil energy balance) as the result of energy exchanges between them and with the atmosphere. Heat conduction also occurs among soil layers. Energy balance can be performed assuming a single canopy layer, with soil and canopy energy balance equations being similar to those of Best et al. [-@Best2011] for JULES. Alternatively, energy balance can be conducted for each vertical layer following @Bonan2014. In this case, the model allows considering within-canopy gradients in temperature, water vapor pressure, and $CO_2$ as well as the turbulent transport of heat, water vapor and $CO_2$ between canopy layers [@Ma2019].

The model also performs the energy balance at the leaf level to determine transpiration [@Sperry2016]. At this scale, radiation inputs include shortwave radiation from the atmosphere absorbed by the leaf and the net balance of long-wave radiation. Leaf temperature is determined assuming that the temperature of the surrounding air is that of the canopy (or canopy layer). After determining stomatal regulation, the model up-scales the transpiration flux to the canopy (or canopy layer) scale and the corresponding latent heat is used to complete the calculation of the energy balance at the canopy (or canopy layer) level. Latent heat fluxes from evaporation from the soil and evaporation of intercepted rainfall are also included in the canopy/soil energy balances.

While plant water content is normally determined by changes in water potential values corresponding to changes in soil moisture and transpiration rates, the model can also consider an explicit water balance within the plant. In this case, the amount of water within plant compartments is explicitly tracked and the rate of extraction of soil water can be decoupled from the rate of transpiration. 

Like in the basic water model, the advanced model assumes by default that soil moisture under all plant cohorts is the same (i.e. water sources corresponding to vertical soil layers are shared among cohorts). However, variations in soil moisture beneath plant cohorts (and, implicitly, horizontal variation of soil moisture) can be simulated. In this case, hydrological processes are replicated for the fraction of soil corresponding to each cohort. Transpiration of each plant cohort depends on the soil moisture beneath itself and, depending on root overlap, on the soil moisture beneath other plant cohorts.

## State variables {#statevariablesadvanced}

The following are state variables in the model under all simulations:

+ Cumulative growth degree days, $GDD$, are tracked by the model and determine leaf phenological status (i.e. $LAI$ values) of winter deciduous species.
+ Daily soil moisture content dynamics on each layer $s$ are tracked using $W_s = \theta_s(\Psi_s)/ \theta_{fc,s}$, the *proportion of soil moisture in relation to field capacity*, where moisture at field capacity, $\theta_{fc,s}$, is assumed to correspond to $\Psi_{fc} = -0.033$ MPa. Note that $W_s$ values larger than one are possible if the soil is between field capacity and saturation (which can happen if deep drainage is not allowed).
+ The temperature of the canopy and of each soil layer ($T_{canopy}$ and $T_{soil,s}$; both in ºC) are tracked for every subdaily step.

Additional state variables depend on the activation of specific control flags (see subsection \@ref(advancedwaterbalancecontrol)):

+ *If plant capacitance effects are considered*, the model also tracks $\Psi_{apo, stem,i}$, the water potential of the stem apoplastic compartment, as well as the water potential of stem and leaf symplastic compartments, $\Psi_{symp, stem,i}$ and $\Psi_{symp, leaf,i}$ respectively.
+ *If cavitation is not completely reversible*, the proportion of stem hydraulic conductance loss for each plant cohort $i$, $PLC_{stem,i}$, becomes a state variable.
+ *If plant water pools are considered*, the model also tracks $W_{i,s}$, the proportion of soil moisture in relation to field capacity for layer $s$ within fraction of stand area covered by cohort $i$.
+ *If multi-layer canopy energy balance is activated*, the model tracks for each vertical layer $h$: (a) the air temperature, $T_{air,h}$; (b) the water vapor pressure, $vp_{h}$; (c) and the $CO_2$ concentration, $C_{air,h}$.

## Water and energy balances {#waterenergybalances}

### Water balance

Daily variations in soil water content ($\Delta{V_{soil}}$ in $mm$) can be summarized as:

\begin{equation}
\Delta{V_{soil}} = Pr + Sm - In - Ru - Dd - Es - Ex
(\#eq:advancedwaterbalanceequation)
\end{equation}

where $Pr$ is precipitation as rainfall, $Sm$ is water reaching the soil from snow melt (if snow-pack dynamics are considered), $In$ is the interception loss (i.e., water evaporated after being intercepted by the canopy), $Ru$ is surface runoff, $Dd$ is deep drainage (i.e. water percolated to layers beyond soil depth), $Es$ is evaporation from soil surface and $Ex$ is water extraction by plants. 

Although the advanced water balance model includes hydraulic redistribution, this does not change the total amount of water in the soil, so the water balance equation is is very similar to that of the basic water balance model (eq.\@ref(eq:basicwaterbalanceequation)). The only difference is that here we used plant extraction ($Ex$) instead of plant transpiration ($Tr$). The two quantities will be the same (i.e. $Ex = Tr$) if plant capacitance effects are not considered. Otherwise the amount of water stored in the plant changes according to:

\begin{equation}
\Delta{V_{plant}} = Ex - Tr
(\#eq:plantwaterbalance)
\end{equation}

While the above describes the default water balance equation, variations can occur depending on specific control flags: 

a. *If snow dynamics are considered*, the water balance of the snow pack is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta{S_{snow}} = Ps - Sm
\end{equation}
where $Ps$ is precipitation as snowfall and $Sm$ is snow melt. Evaporation from bare soil cannot occur if there is a snow pack over the soil surface (i.e., if $S_{snow}>0$ then $Es = 0$). 
b. *If plant water pools are considered*, the water balance equation applies not only to the soil of the overall stand but also to the soil beneath each plant cohort. The fraction of stand area covered by each cohort is used to keep the water balance at the two scales aligned. Moreover, the water balances of soils beneath the different plant cohort are more or less correlated depending on root overlap.

Unlike the basic water balance, in this model water balance components contributing to latent heat ($Es$, $Tr$, $In$ and $Sm$) are included in the energy balance equations of the canopy and soil, therefore coupling water and energy balances.

### Single-layer canopy energy balance

For the sake of performing energy balance, the canopy can be considered a single layer that exchanges energy with the soil and the atmosphere [@Best2011]. First, it absorbs shortwave radiation from the atmosphere ($K_{abs,ca}$) and long-wave radiation resulting from net radiation balance  ($L_{net,ca}$). Other energy fluxes considered are convective exchanges between the canopy and atmosphere ($H_{ca}$) and between the canopy and the soil ($H_{cs}$). Finally, energy is released from the canopy to the atmosphere through latent heat ($LE_{ca}$) produced via transpiration ($Tr$) and evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy ($In$). Combining all energy flows (all of them in $W \cdot m^{-2}$), the instantaneous energy balance equation for the canopy is:
\begin{equation}
  TC_{canopy} \cdot \frac{\delta T_{canopy}}{\delta t} = K_{abs,ca} + L_{net,ca}  - LE_{ca} - H_{ca} - H_{cs} 
(\#eq:canopyenergybalance)
\end{equation}
where $TC_{canopy}$ is the canopy thermal capacitance (in $J \cdot m^{-2} \cdot K^{-1}$). 

### Multiple-layer canopy energy balance
Alternatively, the model allows performing an energy balance for each vertical layer in the canopy, including its heat storage capacity [@Ma2019]. The energy balance equation for canopy layer $h$ is:
\begin{equation}
  TC_{h} \cdot \frac{\delta T_{air,h}}{\delta t} = K_{abs,h} + L_{net,h}  - LE_{h} + H_{h} 
(\#eq:canopylayerenergybalance)
\end{equation}
where $K_{abs,h}$ is the short-wave radiation absorbed by leaves in the layer, $L_{net,h}$ is the net long-wave radiation balance of the layer, $LE_{h}$ is the latent heat flux and $H_h$ is the sensible heat flux, which includes heat coming from leaves or soil surfaces as well as turbulent heat transport from adjacent layers. Finally, $TC_{h}$ is the thermal capacitance (in $J \cdot m^{-2} \cdot K^{-1}$) of canopy layer $h$.

### Soil energy balance

Like the canopy, the uppermost soil layer absorbs short-wave radiation from the atmosphere ($K_{abs,s}$) and has a net long-wave radiation balance ($L_{net,s}$). The uppermost soil layer also exchanges heat with the canopy ($H_{cs}$) and releases energy in the form of latent heat ($LE_{s}$), which includes snow melt ($Sm$) and evaporation from the soil surface ($Es$). Finally, the soil layer exchanges thermal energy by conduction with the layer below ($G_{1,2}$) The energy balance equation for the uppermost soil layer is:
\begin{equation}
  TC_{soil, 1} \cdot \frac{\delta T_{soil, 1}}{\delta t} = K_{abs,s} + L_{net,s} + H_{cs} - LE_{s} - G_{1,2}
(\#eq:soilenergybalance)
\end{equation}
where $TC_{soil,1}$ is the thermal capacitance of soil layer 1 (the uppermost layer). 

Instantaneous soil temperature changes on each soil layer depend on the balance between upward and downward energy flows. The downward energy flow for the uppermost soil layer depends on its energy exchanges with the canopy and the atmosphere, as shown in eq. \@ref(eq:soilenergybalance), whereas the remaining energy flows are generated by heat conduction and depend on the temperature gradients between soil layers. The energy balance for a soil layer $s>1$ is:
\begin{equation}
  TC_{soil, s} \cdot \frac{\delta T_{soil, s}}{\delta t} = G_{s-1,s} - G_{s,s+1}
(\#eq:deepsoilenergybalance)
\end{equation}
where $G_{s-1,s}$ is the energy inflow from layers above, $G_{s,s+1}$ is the energy outflow towards layers below and $TC_{soil,s}$ is the thermal capacitance of soil layer $s$ (in $J \cdot m^{-2} \cdot K^{-1}$).

Unlike @Best2011, the model considers the snow pack and the uppermost soil layer as a single layer in terms of energy exchange, but treats this layer differently depending on whether snow is present or not. The snow pack absorbs shortwave radiation (section \@ref(snowpack)) and snow melt is included as latent heat in the energy balance, but the snow layer does not exchange long-wave radiation with the soil nor the atmosphere. $K_{abs,s}$ is set to zero when snow pack is present (because shortwave radiation is absorbed by snow), but the soil layer still exchanges long-wave radiation and convective energy with the canopy and the atmosphere. In addition, remember that bare soil evaporation does not occur when the snow pack is present (section \@ref(soilevaporation)).  


## Process scheduling {#advancedwaterbalancescheduling}

For every day to be simulated, the model performs the following steps:

1. Update leaf area values according to the phenology of species (sections \@ref(leafphenology)).
2. If snow dynamics are included, increase snow pack from snow precipitation ($Ps$) and decrease it following snow melt ($Sm$) (section \@ref(snowpack)).
3. Determine rainfall interception loss ($In$) and net rainfall ($Pr_{net}$) (section \@ref(interception)).
4. Increase soil water content due to net rainfall ($Pr_{net}$), surface runon ($Ro$) and snow melt ($Sm$), after accounting for surface runoff ($Ru$) and deep drainage ($Dd$) (section \@ref(runoff)).
5. Decrease soil water content due to bare soil evaporation ($Es$), if snow is not present (section \@ref(soilevaporation)).
6. Determine subdaily air temperature and direct/diffuse irradiance variations (chapter \@ref(subdailytemplight)).
7. Determine shortwave radiation absorbed by plant cohorts and the soil at subdaily steps (sections \@ref(shortwaveradiationcanopyabs) and \@ref(shortwaveradiationsoilabs)).
8. Update the water supply function of each plant cohort, according to the hydraulic model and the current soil water potential (chapter \@ref(planthydraulics)). If plant capacitance effects are considered, the supply function involves only the soil-to-stem part of the hydraulic pathway. Otherwise, it describes the complete soil-to-leaf pathway.
9. Determine instantaneous plant cohort transpiration, photosynthesis rates and close soil/canopy energy balance at subdaily steps (chapters \@ref(transpirationsperry) and \@ref(closecanopysoilenergybalance)). This involves the following actions for each subdaily step:
    + Determine long-wave radiation exchange between soil, canopy layers and atmosphere (section \@ref(longwaveradiationexchange)).
    + If plant capacitance effects are considered update the stem-to-leaf hydraulic supply function.
    + Calculate leaf energy balance and photosynthesis (for shade and sunlit leaves of each plant cohort) corresponding to each transpiration value of the supply function (section \@ref(leafenergybalancephoto)). If plant capacitance effects are considered this concerns the stem-to-leaf hydraulic supply function.
    + Determine stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis on shade and sunlit leaves of each plant cohort according to Sperry's [-@Sperry2016] profit maximization strategy (section \@ref(stomatalregulation)).
    + Scale transpiration ($Tr$) and net photosynthesis ($A_n$) from sunlit/shade leaves to the plant cohort level (section \@ref(scalingtranspirationphotosynthesis)).
    + If plant capacitance effects are considered perform water balance of plant compartments at high temporal resolution (1 second steps), while re-estimating the flow from the soil to the stem at each step according to changes in stem water potential (see \@ref(hydraulicswithcompartments)). 
    + Scale water extraction from soil layers ($Ex$) to the plant cohort level.
    + Complete energy balance of the canopy and the soil, after translating plant transpiration, evaporation from bare soil, snow melt and interception loss to latent heat and calculating convective heat exchange for both the canopy and the soil. Alternatively, perform energy balance for individual canopy layers (at 1-min steps), while including turbulent heat exchange and turbulent transport of water vapor and $CO_2$ between layers (chapter \@ref(closecanopysoilenergybalance)).
10. Determine day-level photosynthesis and transpiration from instantaneous rates and update soil moisture (section \@ref(daylevelphototransp)), effectively closing the soil water balance at the daily scale.
11. Determine drought stress for each plant cohort (section \@ref(advanceddroughtstress)).

Details of the formulation of each of these processes are provided within the referred chapters and sections (some processes have been already described in previous chapters/sections).

## Inputs and outputs

### Soil, vegetation and meteorology

**Soil**

Soil input requirements are the same as for the basic water balance model and were fully described in section \@ref(soilinput). @Genuchten1980 water retention curves are forced for this model, because rhizosphere conductance is modelled using van Genuchten hydraulic equations (see subsection \@ref(vulnerabilitycurves)).


**Vegetation**

Vegetation input requirements were fully described in section \@ref(vegetationinput). Trees and shrubs do not need to be characterized with different variables in soil water balance calculations, since both kinds of cohort have a $LAI$ value. In most cases, users only need to estimate the leaf area index corresponding to live leaves, i.e. $LAI^{live}$, because normally at the starting point all leaves are expanded (i.e. $LAI^{\phi} = LAI^{live}$) and one can assume no dead leaves in the canopy (i.e., $LAI^{dead} = 0$). Vegetation characteristics stay constant during simulations using function `spwb()`, although the actual expanded leaf area ($LAI^{\phi}$) and dead leaf area may vary if the species is winter deciduous.


**Meteorology**

The minimum weather variables required to run the model are min/max temperatures ($T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$), min/max relative humidity ($RH_{min}$ and $RH_{max}$), precipitation ($P$) and solar radiation ($Rad$). Wind speed ($u$) is also needed for the advanced water balance model, but the user may use missing values if not available (a default value will be used in this case). Wind speed is assumed to have been measured at a specific height above the canopy (by default at 2 m). Definitions and units of these variables were given in section \@ref(meteoinput).

Vegetation functional attributes are normally filled for each cohort by function `spwbInput()` or `forest2spwbInput()` from species identity. However, different parameters can be specified for different cohorts of the same species if desired (see section \@ref(functionaltraits)). 

### Control parameters {#advancedwaterbalancecontrol}

Control parameters modulate the overall behaviour of water balance simulations (see section \@ref(controlparameters)). There are three **key control parameters**:

1. `transpirationMode` defines the transpiration model, which in turn defines the complexity of the water balance model. If `transpirationMode = "Sperry"` then the advanced water balance model is run. In this model, the water retention curve model is forced to be that of Van Genuchten, i.e. `soilFunctions = "VG"` (see section \@ref(waterretentioncurves)). 
2. `capacitance` defines whether plant capacitance (hence, plant water balance) is considered. By default it is set to `capacitance = FALSE`.
3. `ndailysteps` defines the number of daily substeps. By default `ndailysteps = 24`, so that substeps are hours, but users can increase the temporal resolution, for example to half hour substeps by setting `ndailysteps = 48`.
4. `multiLayerBalance` is a boolean flag to indicate that multi-layer energy balance is desired (by default `multiLayerBalance = FALSE`).

The other control parameters relevant for the advanced water balance model are:

+ `verbose [=TRUE]`: Whether extra console output is desired during simulations.
+ `subdailyResults [=FALSE]`: Boolean flag to force subdaily results to be stored in calls to `spwb()`. Subdaily results are returned as a list called `subdaily` of `spwb_day` objects, one by simulated date. 
+ `snowpack [= TRUE]`:  Whether dynamics of snow pack are included (see section \@ref(snowpack)).
+ `rockyLayerDrainage [= TRUE]`:  Whether water exceeding the field capacity of the deepest layer can be drained via macropore flow towards a non-reachable compartment, only for layers with > 95\% rocks (see section \@ref(runoff)).
+ `leafPhenology [= TRUE]`:  Whether leaf phenology is simulated for winter-deciduous species (see section \@ref(leafphenology)). If `FALSE` then all species are assumed to be evergreen.
+ `defaultWindSpeed [= 2.5]`: Default value for wind speed (in $m \cdot s^{-1}$) when this is missing.
+ `windMeasurementHeight [= 200]`: Distance (in cm) above the top of the canopy corresponding to the measurement of wind speed.
+ `boundaryLayerSize [= 2000]`: Size of the canopy boundary layer (in cm). The boundary layer causes the model to define vertical layers above the top of the canopy. The parameter is only relevant when multi-layer canopy energy balance is performed.
+ `unlimitedSoilWater [=FALSE]`: Boolean flag to indicate the simulation of plant transpiration assuming that soil water is always at field capacity.
+ `plantWaterPools [=FALSE]`: Boolean flag to indicate the simulation of water balance assuming that each cohort has its own water pools.
+ `costModifier, gainModifier [= 1]`: Modifiers (exponents) of the gain and cost functions defined in Sperry et al. (2016) (see section \@ref(stomatalregulation)).
+ `cuticularTranspiration [=TRUE]`: Boolean flag to indicate the simulation of cuticular transpiration (at night or when stomata are fully closed) according to minimum stomatal conductance (see section \@ref(stomatalregulation)).
+ `thermalCapacityLAI [= 1000000]`: Canopy thermal capacitance per LAI unit (see section \@ref(canopycapacitancetemperature)).
+ `verticalLayerSize [= 100]`: The size of vertical layers (in $cm$) for leaf area distribution and light extinction calculations (see section \@ref(leafdistribution)).
+ `cavitationRefill [= "total"]`: Controls recovery from cavitation. If `"total"` cavitation is completely reversible. If `"none"` the model operates in a irreversible cavitation mode. If `"annual"` plants are assumed to recover from previous drought at the first day of the year and, finally, if `"rate"` cavitation recovery follows a daily recovery rate (see section \@ref(cavitationrefill)).
+ `refillMaximumRate [= 0.05]`: Maximum rate of conduit refilling (see section \@ref(cavitationrefill)).
+ `klatstem [= 0.01]`: Stem symplastic-apoplastic lateral conductance (in $mmol·s^{-1}·m^{-2}·MPa^{-1}$). Only relevant when `capacitance = TRUE` (see section \@ref(hydraulicswithcompartments)).
+ `klatleaf [= 0.01]`: Leaf symplastic-apoplastic lateral conductance (in $mmol·s^{-1}·m^{-2}·MPa^{-1}$). Only relevant when `capacitance = TRUE` (see section \@ref(hydraulicswithcompartments)).
+ `numericParams`: A list with params for numerical approximation routines.
+ `Catm [=386]`: Atmospheric $CO_2$ concentration (in micromol $CO_2 \cdot mol^{-1}$ = ppm).

In addition, a number of control parameters are used to modify how hydraulic parameters are estimated when calling function `spwbInput()`: 

+ `taper [= TRUE]`: Whether taper of xylem conduits is accounted for when estimating aboveground stem conductance from xylem conductivity.
+ `fracRootResistance [= 0.40]`: Fraction of plant total resistance (leaf+stem+root) that corresponds to root system. 
+ `averageFracRhizosphereResistance [= 0.15]`: Fraction to total continuum (stem+root+rhizosphere) resistance that corresponds to rhizosphere (averaged across soil water potential values).

#### Subdaily output

Calling function `spwb_day()` with the advanced water balance model results in subdaily results for the simulated date. When running the advanced water balance model with function `spwb()` one can request subdaily results to be included with the function output. This is done via setting  `subdailyResults = TRUE` in the control parameter list. In that case, the output list of `spwb()` will include an element `subdaily`, whose subelements correspond to the results of `spwb_day()` for each date simulated. Refer to the documentation of functions `spwb_day()` and `transp_transpirationSperry()` for details of subdaily output.


## Applications

All the applications mentioned in section \@ref(basicwaterbalanceapplications) for the basic water balance model would be, in principle, valid for the advanced model. However, the difference in model complexity and the corresponding increase in parametrization make the advanced model less appealing for the average user. To our experience, its estimates of soil moisture dynamics are only slighly more accurate than those of the basic model. The advanced water balance model is, however, justified whenever:

1. Precise estimates are desired for the transpiration flows and/or water potential values of each plant cohort, taking into account their vertical position within the stand.
2. One is interested in modelling subdaily variation of plant processes such as photosynthesis, transpiration and water use efficiency.
3. One is interested in canopy and/or soil energy balances (note that these model outputs have not yet been contrasted against observations), or the plant water balance.  
4. Hydraulic redistribution is believed to be a key process in soil moisture dynamics.
5. To generate predictions for meta-modelling studies, for example to improve certain processes of another model, such as our basic water balance model.

These model uses belong mostly to eco-hydrological research rather than to applications intended to provide information for forest management. For this reason, we believe the advanced model to be useful to researchers.
