## Day-level photosynthesis and transpiration {#daylevelphototransp}

Stomatal regulation and plant transpiration are determined for each time step separately. While the cost function is the same for the whole day, the gain function and profit maximization calculations are conducted for each of the time steps, yielding instantaneous flow values $E_{t, s}$ for each soil layer $s$, in $mmol\,H_2O·s^{-1}·m^{-2}$ of leaf area unit and instantaneous net assimilation values $A_{n,t}$ in $\mu mol\, C·s^{-1}·m^{-2}$ of ground area (i.e. at the cohort level). To obtain daily values of transpiration at the cohort level the instantaneous flow rates $E_{t, s}$ need to be scaled to $E_{step,s}$ using:
\begin{equation}
E_{step,s} = E_{t,s}\cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 0.01802 \cdot LAI_i^{\phi}\cdot \Delta t
\end{equation}
where $0.01802$ is the molar weight (in kg = L = mm) of water, $LAI_i^{\phi}$ is the leaf area index of plant cohort $i$ and $\Delta t_{step} = 86400/n_t$ the size of the time step in seconds, being $n_t$ the number of time steps. The flow rates $E_{step,s}$ of all steps are added to yield $E_s$ (in $mm\,H_2O$):
\begin{equation}
E_{s} = \sum_{n=1}^{n_t} {E_{step,s}}
\end{equation}
and substracted from the water content of the corresponding soil layer. Daily values of net carbon assimilation for plant cohorts are obtained similarly. The instantaneous rates $A_{n, t}$ are scaled to $A_{n,step}$ using:
\begin{equation}
A_{n,step} = A_{n, t} \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot 12.01017 \cdot \Delta t
\end{equation}
where $12.01017$ is the molar weight of carbon (in g). $A_{n, step}$ values of all steps are added to obtain $A_n$, the daily net assimilation at the cohort level (in $g\,C·m^{-2}$):
\begin{equation}
A_{n,step} = \sum_{n=1}^{n_t} {A_{n,step}}
\end{equation}

## Plant drought stress and water potentials {#advanceddroughtstress}

Because the model determines optimum transpiration for each time step, this leads to a daily sequence of leaf water potential ($\Psi_{leaf,t}$) and root crown water potential ($\Psi_{rootcrown,t}$) values. The model chooses as the leaf water potential of the day for cohort $i$ ($\Psi_{leaf,i}$) the minimum of $\Psi_{leaf,t}$ values. Analogously, the model chooses as the root crown water potential of the day for cohort $i$ ($\Psi_{rootcrown,i}$) the minimum of $\Psi_{rootcrown,t}$ values. They represent water potential values that would occur at mid-day. Unlike under the simple transpiration mode, here there is no need to average water potentials under the Sperry transpiration mode, because the differences in potential of soil layers are already integrated in the hydraulic supply function. 

In order to have an estimate of daily drought stress for the plant cohort, the model uses the stem vulnerability curve of the plant to find the conductance relative to maximum stem conductance and turns it into its complement:

\begin{equation}
DDS_i = \phi_i \cdot \left( 1.0 - \frac{k_{stem, i}(\Psi_{rootcrown,i})}{k_{\max stem, i}}\right) = \phi_i \cdot \left(1.0 - e^{-(\Psi_{rootcrown,i}/d_{stem})^{c_{stem}}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\phi_i$ is the leaf phenological status. Note the use of $\Psi_{rootcrown,i}$ (and not $\Psi_{leaf,i}$) to determine drought stress index. Thus the model tracks the degree of conductance decrease at the beginning of the stem as a measure of drought stress. This choice makes daily drought stress values of the Simple and Complex transpiration modes more comparable (because leaf mid-day water potentials are usually much more negative than soil water potentials) and is a sensible choice if one wants to run the model in irreversible cavitation mode (see below).
