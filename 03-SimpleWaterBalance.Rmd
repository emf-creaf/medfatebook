# Basic water balance model {#basicwaterbalance}

This chapter provides an overview of the water balance model described in @DeCaceres2015, which allows simulating water flows, soil moisture and plant drought stress dynamics on a daily step basis for a given forest stand and for the period corresponding to input weather data. The model is run using function `spwb()`, for a set of days, or function `spwb_day()`, for a single day. Alternatively, one can use function `pwb()` to evaluate plant transpiration and drought stress resulting from given weather and soil moisture dynamics.

The information provided in this chapter should be enough to understand what the model does and when it can be useful, but the reading the following ones should provide a more detailed understanding on how the different processes are formulated.

## Design principles {#basicdesign}

The model considers only the vertical spatial dimension of the stand and not the horizontal distribution of plants within it. In other words, the model is not spatially explicit (i.e., plants do not have horizontal coordinates nor interact for space explicitly). Woody vegetation in the stand is divided into groups, here referred to as *plant cohorts* of different species, height and leaf area index ($LAI$). Height and $LAI$ values determine competition for light. $LAI$ values also drive competition for soil water, along with fine root distribution. 

The soil water balance follows the design principles of SIERRA [@Mouillot2001;@Ruffault2014;@Ruffault2013] and BILJOU [@Granier1999;-@Granier2007], although some features are taken from other models [@Kergoat1998]. Hydrological processes include water interception loss [@Gash1995], plant transpiration, evaporation from soil [@Ritchie1972] and the partition between infiltration and runoff [@Boughton1989]. Infiltrated water is either retained by capilarity or percolates through soil layers, depending on macroporosity, and water exceeding soil water holding capacity is lost beyond the rooting zone via deep drainage. Snow pack dynamics can also be simulated. Potential evapotranspiration ($PET$) is a required input and the model determines maximum canopy transpiration ($Tr_{\max}$) using an empirical relationship between the $LAI$ of the stand and the ratio $Tr_{\max}/PET$ [@Granier1999]. Actual plant transpiration is estimated using a function that depends not only on $Tr_{\max}$ but also on current soil moisture levels, cohort-specific drought resistance, fine root distribution and the degree of shading of the target plant cohort.

By default, the model assumes that soil moisture under all plant cohorts is the same (i.e. water sources corresponding to vertical soil layers are shared among cohorts). However, variations in soil moisture beneath plant cohorts (and, implicitly, horizontal variation of soil moisture) can be simulated. In this case, hydrological processes are replicated for the fraction of soil corresponding to each cohort. Transpiration of each plant cohort depends on the soil moisture beneath itself and, depending on root overlap, on the soil moisture beneath other plant cohorts.

## State variables {#statevariablesbasic}

The following are state variables in the model under all simulations:

+ Cumulative degree days (a) to budburst, (b) to complete unfolding or (c) to senescence ($S_{eco,d}$, $S_{unf,d}$ or $S_{sen,d}$; all in $^\circ C$), are tracked by the model to determine leaf phenological status (see \@ref(leafphenology)).
+ Soil moisture content dynamics on each layer $s$ are tracked daily using $W_s = \theta_s(\Psi)/ \theta_{fc,s}$, the *proportion of soil moisture in relation to field capacity*, where moisture at field capacity, $\theta_{fc,s}$, is assumed to correspond to $\Psi_{fc} = -0.033$ MPa. Note that $W_s$ values larger than one are possible if the soil is between field capacity and saturation (which can happen if deep drainage is not allowed).

Additional state variables depend on the activation of specific control flags:

+ *If snow accumulation/melting is considered*, the model tracks $S_{snow}$, the snow water equivalent (in mm) of the snow pack storage over the surface.
+ *If stem cavitation is not completely reversible*, the model tracks $PLC_{i}$, the proportion of stem conductivity lost by plants of cohort $i$.
+ *If plant water pools are considered*, the model also tracks $W_{i,s}$, the proportion of soil moisture in relation to field capacity for layer $s$ within the areal fraction of the stand covered by cohort $i$.

## Water balance {#soilwaterbalance}

Daily variations in soil water content ($\Delta{V_{soil}}$ in mm) can be summarized as:

\begin{equation}
\Delta{V_{soil}} = Pr + Sm - In - Ru - Dd - Es -Tr
(\#eq:basicwaterbalanceequation)
\end{equation}

where $Pr$ is precipitation as rainfall, $Sm$ is water from melting the snow pack (if considered), $In$ is the interception loss (i.e., water evaporated after being intercepted by the canopy), $Ru$ is surface runoff, $Dd$ is deep drainage (i.e. water percolated to layers beyond soil depth), $Es$ is evaporation from soil and $Tr$ is plant transpiration. 

While the above describes the default water balance equation, variations can occur depending on specific control flags: 

a. *If snow dynamics are considered*, the water balance of the snow pack ($\Delta{S_{snow}}$ in mm of snow water equivalents) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta{S_{snow}} = Ps - Sm
(\#eq:snowbalanceequation)
\end{equation}
where $Ps$ is precipitation as snowfall and $Sm$ is snow melt. Evaporation from bare soil cannot occur if there is a snow pack over the soil (i.e., if $S_{snow}>0$ then $Es = 0$).
b. *If plant water pools are considered*, the water balance equation applies not only to the soil of the overall stand but also to the soil beneath each plant cohort. The fraction of stand area covered by each cohort is used to keep the water balance at the two scales aligned. Moreover, the water balances of soils beneath the different plant cohort are more or less correlated depending on root overlap.

## Process scheduling {#basicwaterbalancescheduling}

For every day to be simulated, the model performs the following steps:

  1. Update leaf area values according to the phenology of species and recalculate light extinction (sections \@ref(leafphenology) and \@ref(basiclightextinction)).
  2. If snow dynamics are included, increase snow pack from snow precipitation ($Ps$) and decrease it following snow melt ($Sm$) (section \@ref(snowpack)).
  3. Determine rainfall interception loss ($In$) and net rainfall ($Pr_{net}$) (section \@ref(interception))
  4. Increase soil water content due to net rainfall ($Pr_{net}$), surface runon ($Ro$) and snow melt ($Sm$), after accounting for surface runoff ($Ru$) and deep drainage ($Dd$) (section \@ref(runoff)).
  5. Decrease soil water content due to bare soil evaporation ($Es$), if snow is not present (section \@ref(soilevaporation)).
  6. Determine transpiration, photosynthesis and drought stress for each plant cohort  and decrease soil water content due to plant transpiration ($Tr$) (chapter \@ref(transpirationgranier)).

Details of the formulation of each of these processes are provided within the referred chapters and sections. *If plant water pools are considered*, steps 4-5 are performed for each plant water pool separately, step 6 involves extracting water from different plant water pools depending on the proportion of fine roots of each cohort in each pool (see \@ref(transpirationpools)). 

## Inputs and outputs {#basicwaterbalanceinputsoutputs}

### Soil, vegetation and meteorology

**Soil**

Soil input requirements are fully described in section \@ref(soilinput).

**Vegetation**

Vegetation input requirements are fully described in section \@ref(vegetationinput). Trees and shrubs do not need to be characterized with different variables in soil water balance calculations, since both kinds of cohorts have a $LAI$ value. In most cases, users only need to estimate the leaf area index corresponding to live leaves, i.e. $LAI^{live}$, because normally at the starting point all leaves are expanded (i.e. $LAI^{\phi} = LAI^{live}$) and one can assume no dead leaves in the canopy (i.e., $LAI^{dead} = 0$). Vegetation characteristics stay constant during simulations using function `spwb()`, although the actual expanded leaf area ($LAI^{\phi}$) and dead leaf area ($LAI^{dead}$) may vary is the species is winter deciduous.

**Meteorology**

The minimum daily weather variables required to run the model are mean temperature ($T_{mean}$), precipitation ($P$) and potential evapotranspiration ($PET$). Solar radiation ($Rad$) is required if snow pack dynamics have to be simulated. Additionally, the user may also specify values of wind speed ($u$) that are used to control leaf fall in autumn. Definitions and units of these variables are given in section \@ref(meteoinput).

### Vegetation functional parameters {#basicwatervegetationparameters}

A relatively small set of functional parameters should be supplied for each plant cohort $i$. A first set of parameters relate to light extinction and water interception (`paramsInterception`):

| Symbol | Units | R  | Description                                  | 
|--------|-------|----| ---------------------------------------------|
| $k_{PAR}$ | | `kPAR` | PAR extinction coefficient (see section \@ref(basiclightextinction)). |
| $s_{water}$ | $mm\,H_2OÂ·LAI^{-1}$ | `g` | Crown water storage capacity (i.e. depth of water that can be retained by leaves and branches) per LAI unit (see section \@ref(interception)). |

A second set refers to leaf phenology (`paramsPhenology`):

| Symbol | Units | R  | Description                                  | 
|--------|-------|----| ---------------------------------------------|
|        |       |  `PhenologyType`  | Leaf phenology type (oneflush-evergreen, progressive-evergreen, winter-deciduous, winter-semideciduous)|
| $LD$ | years  | `LeafDuration` | Average duration of leaves (in years). |
| $t_{0,eco}$ | days | `t0gdd` | Date to start the accumulation of degree days. |
| $S^*_{eco}$ | $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ | `Sgdd` | Degree days corresponding to leaf budburst (see section \@ref(leafphenobudburst)). |
| $T_{eco}$ | $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ | `Tbgdd` | Base temperature for the calculation of degree days to leaf budburst (see section \@ref(leafphenobudburst)). |
| $S^*_{sen}$ | $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ | `Ssen` | Degree days corresponding to leaf senescence (see section \@ref(leafphenosenescence)). |
| $Ph_{sen}$ | hours | `Phsen` | Photoperiod corresponding to start counting senescence degree-days (see section \@ref(leafphenosenescence)). |
| $T_{sen}$ | $^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ | `Tbsen` | Base temperature for the calculation of degree days to leaf senescence (see section \@ref(leafphenosenescence)). |
| $x_{sen}$ | {0,1,2}  | `xsen` | Discrete values, to allow for any absent/proportional/more than proportional effects of temperature on senescence (see section \@ref(leafphenosenescence)). |
| $y_{sen}$ | {0,1,2}  | `ysen` | Discrete values, to allow for any absent/proportional/more than proportional effects of photoperiod on senescence (see section \@ref(leafphenosenescence)). |

A second set of parameters are related to transpiration and photosynthesis (`paramsTranspiration`):

| Symbol | Units | R  | Description                                  | 
|--------|-------|----| ---------------------------------------------|
| $T_{max, LAI}$ |       | `Tmax_LAI` | Empirical coefficient relating LAI with the ratio of maximum transpiration over potential evapotranspiration (see section \@ref(maximumtranspiration)). |
| $T_{max, sqLAI}$ |       | `Tmax_LAIsq` | Empirical coefficient relating squared LAI with the ratio of maximum transpiration over potential evapotranspiration (see section \@ref(maximumtranspiration)). |
| $\Psi_{extract}$ | $MPa$ | `Psi_Extract` |  The water potential at which plant transpiration is 50% of its maximum (see section \@ref(actualtranspiration)).|
| $\Psi_{critic}$ | $MPa$ | `Psi_Critic` |  The water potential corresponding to 50% of  cavitation (see section \@ref(irreversiblecavitation)).|
| $WUE_{\max}$ | $g\, C \cdot mm^{-1}$ |  `WUE` |  Maximum water use efficiency under full light and no water limitations (see section \@ref(basicphotosynthesis)).  |

| $K_{rootdisc}$ | [0-1] |  `pRootDisc` |  Whole-plant relative transpiration corresponding to hydraulic disconnection from the soil (see section \@ref(irreversiblecavitation)).  |

Vegetation functional attributes are normally filled for each cohort $i$ by function `spwbInput()` or `forest2spwbInput()` from species identity (i.e. $SP_i$). However, different parameters can be specified for different cohorts of the same species if desired (see section \@ref(functionaltraits)). 

### Control parameters  {#basicwaterbalancecontrol}

Control parameters modulate the overall behaviour of water balance simulations (see section \@ref(controlparameters)). Most importantly, `transpirationMode` defines the transpiration model, which in turn defines the complexity of the water balance model. If `transpirationMode = "Granier"` (the default value) then the basic water balance model is used. 

The other control parameters for the basic water balance model are:

+ `soilFunctions [="SX"]`: Soil water retention curve and conductivity functions, either 'SX' (for Saxton) or 'VG' (for Van Genuchten). 
+ `defaultWindSpeed [= 2.5]`: Default value for wind speed (in $m \cdot s^{-1}$) when this is missing (only used for leaf fall, see section \@ref(leafphenology)).
+ `snowpack [= TRUE]`:  Whether dynamics of snow pack are included (see section \@ref(snowpack)).
+ `leafPhenology [ = TRUE]`:  Whether leaf phenology is simulated (see section \@ref(leafphenology)). If `FALSE` then all species are assumed to be evergreen.
+ `rockyLayerDrainage [= TRUE]`:  Whether water exceeding the field capacity of the deepest layer can be drained via macropore flow towards a non-reachable compartment, only for layers with > 95\% rocks (see section \@ref(runoff)).
+ `unlimitedSoilWater [=FALSE]`: Boolean flag to indicate the simulation of plant transpiration assuming that soil water is always at field capacity.
+ `unfoldingDD [= 300]`: Degree-days for complete leaf unfolding after budburst has occurred ($S_{unf}^*$; see section \@ref(leafphenobudburst)).
+ `plantWaterPools [=FALSE]`: Boolean flag to indicate the simulation of water balance assuming that each cohort has its own water pools.
+ `verticalLayerSize [= 100]`: Size of vertical layers (in cm) for the calculation of light extinction (see section \@ref(leafdistribution)).
+ `windMeasurementHeight [ = 200]`: Height (in cm) over the canopy corresponding to wind measurements.
+ `cavitationRefill [= "total"]`: A string indicating how refilling of embolized conduits is done  (see section \@ref(irreversiblecavitation). Allowed values are: 
  + `"none"` - no refilling.
  + `"annual"` - every first day of the year.
  + `"total"` - instantaneous complete refilling.

### Model output {#basicwaterbalanceoutput}

Functions `spwb()` and `pwb()` return a list of a class with the same name. The first four elements of this list (i.e., `latitude`, `topography`, `spwbInput` and `soilInput`) are simply copies of model inputs. The next four elements correspond to *water balance flows*, *soil state* variables, *stand-level* variables, and *plant-level* variables:

| Element | Description                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WaterBalance`| Climatic input and water balance flows (i.e. net precipitation, infiltration, runoff, transpiration...). All of them in $mm = l \cdot m^{-2}$. |
| `Soil`| Soil variables for each soil layer: Moisture relative to field capacity ($W_s$), water potential ($\Psi_s$) and volumetric water content ($V_s$). |
| `Stand`| Stand-level variables, such as $LAI^{\phi}_{stand}$, $LAI^{dead}_{stand}$, the water retention capacity of the canopy ($S_{canopy}$) or the fraction of light reaching the ground ($L^{PAR}_{ground}$ and $L^{SWR}_{ground}$).|
| `Plants`| Plant-level variables, such as $LAI^{phi}_i$, plant transpiration, plant water potential, etc. |

Elements `WaterBalance`, `Soil` and `Stand` are data frame with dates in rows and variables in columns, whereas `Plants` is itself a list with several elements,  with dates in rows and plant cohorts in columns:

| Element | Symbol | Units | Description                               |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
|`LAI`| $LAI^{\phi}_i$ | $m^2 \cdot m^{-2}$ | Leaf area index (expanded).|
|`AbsorbedSWRFraction` | $f_i$ | [0-1] | Fraction of shortwave radiation absorbed.|
|`Transpiration`| $Tr_{i}$ | mm | Transpiration per unit ground area.|
|`GrossPhotosynthesis`| $A_{n,i}$ | $g\,C \cdot m^{-2}$ | Gross photosynthesis per unit ground area.|
|`PlantPsi` | $\Psi_{leaf,i}$ | $MPa$ | Plant water potential.|
|`StemPLC` | $PLC_{i}$ | [0-1] | Degree of stem embolisation.|
|`PlantStress` | $DDS_i$ | [0-1] | Drought stress level suffered by each plant cohort (relative whole-plant transpiration).|

The output of simulations can be inspected using `plot` and `summary` functions specific to `spwb` objects (examples are given in the corresponding package *vignette*).

As it simulates water balance for only one day, function `spwb_day()` returns a much more reduced output. This function is most useful with advanced water balance modelling (chapter \@ref(advancedwaterbalance)).

## Applications {#basicwaterbalanceapplications}

The basic water balance model is relatively easy to parametrize and use. Moreover, the model is quite fast. These features make it appropriate for applications that do not seek a high predictive at the plant level, but require robust estimates at the stand, landscape or regional levels. In our opinion the basic water balance model may be useful for the following applications: 

1. To monitor or forecast temporal variation in transpiration flows and soil water content in particular stands or in multiple stands across a landscape or region. 
2. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands or in multiple stands across a landscape or region (for example to anticipate mortality events).

For example, @Karavani2018 employed the water balance to provide sound estimates of soil moisture dynamics to predict mushroom production in a network forest stands. The model is particularly interesting to test the relationship between forest structure/composition and the water balance at the stand level or the drought stress suffered by plants, as done in @Ameztegui2017. See also another application in @Rolo2019.
