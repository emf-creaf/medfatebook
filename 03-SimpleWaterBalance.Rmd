# Basic water balance model {#basicwaterbalance}

This chapter provides an overview of the basic soil and plant water balance model included in **medfate**. The model allows simulating vertical water fluxes in a forest stand, and performs soil and plant water balance on a daily step basis for the period corresponding to input weather data. 

The model is run using function `spwb()`, for a set of days, or function `spwb_day()`, for a single day. Alternatively, one can use function `pwb()` to evaluate plant transpiration and drought stress resulting from given weather and soil moisture dynamics. The basic water balance model corresponds to the control variable `transpirationMode = "Granier"`.

The description of the model presented here conforms to a large extent to the description given in @DeCaceres2015, but includes several modifications that have been implemented since the publication of this scientific article. The information provided in this chapter should be enough to understand what the model does and when it can be useful, but the reading the following ones should provide a more detailed understanding on how the different processes are formulated.

## Design principles {#basicdesign}

The water balance model considers only the vertical spatial dimension of the stand and not the horizontal distribution of plants within it. In other words, the model is not spatially explicit (i.e., plants do not have horizontal coordinates nor interact for space explicitly). Woody vegetation in the stand is divided into groups, here referred to as *plant cohorts* of different species, height and leaf area index ($LAI$). Height and $LAI$ values determine competition for light. $LAI$ values also drive competition for soil water, along with fine root distribution. The model can also consider a layer herbaceous vegetation, which also has a height value and $LAI$, but where plant cohorts are not distinguished and with fine roots confined to the topmost layer. 

The soil water balance follows the design principles of SIERRA [@Mouillot2001;@Ruffault2014;@Ruffault2013] and BILJOU [@Granier1999;-@Granier2007], although some soil hydrology features are taken from @Kergoat1998 and @bonan_climate_2019. Hydrological processes include water interception loss [@Gash1995], plant transpiration, evaporation from bare soil [@Ritchie1972], the partition between infiltration and runoff [@Boughton1989], Darcian vertical water movement [@bonan_climate_2019] and deep drainage. Infiltrated water is either retained by capillarity or percolates through soil layers, depending on macro-porosity, and water exceeding soil water holding capacity is lost beyond the rooting zone via deep drainage. Snow pack dynamics can also be simulated. Potential evapo-transpiration ($PET$) is a required input and the model determines maximum herbaceous and maximum canopy transpiration ($Tr_{\max}$) using an empirical relationship between the $LAI$ of the stand and the ratio $Tr_{\max}/PET$ [@Granier1999]. Actual plant transpiration is estimated using a function that depends not only on $Tr_{\max}$ but also on current soil moisture levels, cohort-specific drought resistance, fine root distribution and the degree of shading of the target plant cohort. When soil water deficit progresses transpiration rates are consequently reduced, but minimum transpiration rates of woody vegetation are not zero, because of the role of cuticular transpiration and imperfectly closed stomata [@Duursma2018]. Woody plant water status (i.e. plant water potential and, hence, plant water content) follows variations of soil moisture in the soil layers where fine roots are located. 

By default, the model assumes that soil moisture under all plant cohorts is the same (i.e. water sources corresponding to vertical soil layers are shared among cohorts). However, 3D variations in soil moisture beneath plant cohorts can be simulated in spatially-explicit forest ecosystem models [@Manoli2017; @Rotzer2017]. The water balance model does not simulate horizontal spatial processes explicitly, but allows considering more or less independent water pools for plant cohorts. If partial or completely independent water pools are considered, hydrological processes are replicated for the fraction of soil corresponding to each woody cohort. Transpiration of each plant cohort depends on the soil moisture beneath itself and, depending on the degree of rhizosphere overlap, on the soil moisture beneath other plant cohorts.

## State variables {#statevariablesbasic}

The following are state variables in the model under all simulations:

+ Cumulative degree days (a) to budburst, (b) to complete unfolding or (c) to senescence ($S_{eco,d}$, $S_{unf,d}$ or $S_{sen,d}$; all in $^\circ C$), are tracked by the model to determine leaf phenological status (see \@ref(leafphenology)).
+ Soil moisture content dynamics on each layer $s$ are tracked daily using $W_s = \theta_s(\Psi)/ \theta_{fc,s}$, the *proportion of soil moisture in relation to field capacity*, where moisture at field capacity, $\theta_{fc,s}$, is assumed to correspond to $\Psi_{fc} = -0.033$ MPa. Note that $W_s$ values larger than one are possible if the soil is between field capacity and saturation (which can happen if deep drainage is not allowed).
+ Plant water potential ($\Psi_{plant,i}$) of each plant cohort $i$ are also tracked daily and follows the soil water potential of layers (or water pools) where fine roots are located.

Additional state variables depend on the activation of specific control flags:

+ *If snow accumulation/melting is considered*, the model tracks $S_{snow}$, the snow water equivalent (in mm) of the snow pack storage over the surface.
+ *If stem cavitation is not completely reversible*, the model tracks $PLC_{stem, i}$ and $PLC_{leaf, i}$, the proportion of conductivity lost the stem and leaves, respectively, of plants of cohort $i$.
+ *If the degree of rhizosphere overlap between plant cohorts is not total* (i.e. if `rhizosphereOverlap = "none"` or `rhizosphereOverlap = "partial"`), the model also tracks $W_{i,s}$, the proportion of soil moisture in relation to field capacity for layer $s$ within the areal fraction of the stand covered by the woody cohort $i$.

## Water balance {#soilwaterbalance}

Daily variations in soil water content ($\Delta{V_{soil}}$ in mm) can be summarized as:

\begin{equation}
\Delta{V_{soil}} = Pr + Sm - In - Ru - Dd - Es - Tr_{herb} - Tr_{woody}
(\#eq:basicwaterbalanceequation)
\end{equation}

where $Pr$ is precipitation as rainfall, $Sm$ is water from melting the snow pack (if considered), $In$ is the interception loss (i.e., water evaporated after being intercepted by the canopy), $Ru$ is surface runoff, $Dd$ is deep drainage (i.e. water percolated to layers beyond soil depth), $Es$ is evaporation from soil, $Tr_{herb}$ is the transpiration made by herbaceous plants and $Tr_{woody}$ is the transpiration made by woody plants. 

While the above describes the default water balance equations, variations can occur depending on specific control flags: 

a. *If snow dynamics are considered*, the water balance of the snow pack ($\Delta{S_{snow}}$ in mm of snow water equivalents) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta{S_{snow}} = Ps - Sm
(\#eq:snowbalanceequation)
\end{equation}
where $Ps$ is precipitation as snowfall and $Sm$ is snow melt. Evaporation from bare soil cannot occur if there is a snow pack over the soil (i.e., if $S_{snow}>0$ then $Es = 0$).
b. *If plant water pools are considered*, the water balance equation applies not only to the soil of the overall stand but also to the soil beneath each woody plant cohort. The fraction of stand area corresponding to the water pool of each cohort is used to keep the water balance at the two scales aligned. Moreover, the water balances of soils beneath the different plant cohort are more or less correlated depending on the degree of rhizosphere overlap.

## Process scheduling {#basicwaterbalancescheduling}

For every day to be simulated, the model performs the following steps:

  1. Update leaf area values according to the phenology of species and recalculate radiation extinction (sections \@ref(leafphenology) and \@ref(basiclightextinction)).
  2. If snow dynamics are included, increase snow pack from snow precipitation ($Ps$) and decrease it following snow melt ($Sm$) (section \@ref(snowpack)).
  3. Determine rainfall interception loss ($In$) and net rainfall ($Pr_{net}$) (section \@ref(interception))
  4. Increase soil water content due to net rainfall ($Pr_{net}$), surface runon ($Ro$) and snow melt ($Sm$), after accounting for partitioning between infiltration and surface runoff ($Ru$) (section \@ref(runoff)).
  5. Determine bare soil evaporation ($Es$), if snow is not present (section \@ref(soilevaporation)), and herbaceous transpiration ($Tr_{herb}$; section \@ref(herbaceoustranspiration)).
  6. Determine woody plant transpiration ($Tr_{woody}$), including hydraulic redistribution, and photosynthesis (chapter \@ref(transpirationgranier)).
  7. Determine vertical water movement in the soil, while considering source/sinks from bare soil evaporation and herbaceous/woody plant extraction (section \@ref(richards)). 
  8. Update plant water potential ($\Psi_{plant}$) and plant drought stress for each plant cohort and decrease soil water content due to woody plant transpiration.

Details of the formulation of each of these processes are provided within the referred chapters and sections. *If plant water pools are considered*, steps 4-5 are performed for each plant water pool separately, step 6 involves defining extraction from different plant water pools depending on the proportion of fine roots of each cohort in each pool (see \@ref(transpirationpools)). Step 7 is also performed the soil corresponding to each pool and, finally, overall soil moisture is updated using pool proportions as weights.

## Inputs and outputs {#basicwaterbalanceinputsoutputs}

### Soil, vegetation and meteorology

**Soil**

Soil input requirements are fully described in section \@ref(soilinput).

**Vegetation**

Vegetation input requirements are fully described in section \@ref(vegetationinput). Trees and shrubs do not need to be characterized with different variables in soil water balance calculations, since both kinds of woody cohorts have a $LAI$ value. In most cases, users only need to estimate the leaf area index corresponding to live leaves, i.e. $LAI^{live}$, because normally at the starting point all leaves are expanded (i.e. $LAI^{\phi} = LAI^{live}$) and one can assume no dead leaves in the canopy (i.e., $LAI^{dead} = 0$). Vegetation characteristics stay constant during simulations using function `spwb()`, although the actual expanded leaf area ($LAI^{\phi}$) and dead leaf area ($LAI^{dead}$) may vary is the species is winter deciduous.

**Meteorology**

The minimum weather variables required to run the model are min/max temperatures ($T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$), min/max relative humidity ($RH_{min}$ and $RH_{max}$), precipitation ($P$) and solar radiation ($Rad$). Wind speed ($u$) is also needed, but the user may use missing values if not available (a default value will be used in this case). Wind speed is assumed to have been measured at a specific height above the canopy (by default at 2 m). Atmospheric $CO_2$ concentration ($C_{atm}$) may also be specified, but if missing a default constant value is assumed, which is taken from the control parameters. Definitions and units of these variables were given in section \@ref(meteoinput).

### Vegetation functional parameters {#basicwatervegetationparameters}

The following sets of functional parameters should be supplied for each woody plant cohort. In practice, they are normally estimated from the species-specific parameter table and imputation of missing values (see \@ref(modelparametrization)). Functional attributes are filled for each cohort $i$ by function `forest2spwbInput()` from species identity (i.e. $SP_i$). However, different parameters can be specified for different cohorts of the same species if desired (see section \@ref(functionaltraits)).

### Control parameters  {#basicwaterbalancecontrol}

Control parameters modulate the overall behaviour of water balance simulations (see section \@ref(controlparameters)). Most importantly, `transpirationMode` defines the transpiration model, which in turn defines the complexity of the water balance model. If `transpirationMode = "Granier"` (the default value) then the basic water balance model is used. 

The other relevant control parameters for the basic water balance model are:

+ `soilFunctions [="SX"]`: Soil water retention curve and conductivity functions, either 'SX' (for Saxton) or 'VG' (for Van Genuchten). 
+ `defaultWindSpeed [= 2.5]`: Default value for wind speed (in $m \cdot s^{-1}$) when this is missing (only used for leaf fall, see section \@ref(leafphenology)).
+ `defaultCO2 [=386]`: Default atmospheric (abovecanopy) $CO_2$ concentration (in micromol $CO_2 \cdot mol^{-1}$ = ppm). This value will be used whenever $CO_2$ concentration is not specified in the weather input.
+ `snowpack [= TRUE]`:  Whether dynamics of snow pack are included (see section \@ref(snowpack)).
+ `leafPhenology [ = TRUE]`:  Whether leaf phenology is simulated (see section \@ref(leafphenology)). If `FALSE` then all species are assumed to be evergreen.
+ `bareSoilEvaporation [= TRUE]`:  Whether evaporation from the soil surface is simulated (see section \@ref(soilevaporation)).
+ `unlimitedSoilWater [=FALSE]`: Boolean flag to indicate the simulation of plant transpiration assuming that soil water is always at field capacity.
+ `unfoldingDD [= 300]`: Degree-days for complete leaf unfolding after budburst has occurred ($S_{unf}^*$; see section \@ref(leafphenobudburst)).
+ `fireHazardResults [= FALSE]`: Boolean flag to force calculation of daily fire hazard.
+ `rhizosphereOverlap [="total]`: A string indicating the degree of rhizosphere spatial overlap between plant cohorts:
   + `"none"` - no overlap (independent water pools).
   + `"partial"` - partial overlap determined by coarse root volume.
   + `"total"` - total overlap (plants extract from common soil pools).
+ `verticalLayerSize [= 100]`: Size of vertical layers (in cm) for the calculation of light extinction (see section \@ref(leafdistribution)).
+ `windMeasurementHeight [ = 200]`: Height (in cm) over the canopy corresponding to wind measurements.
+ `cavitationRefillStem/cavitationRefillLeaves [= "annual"]`: A string indicating how refilling of embolized conduits is done  (see section \@ref(irreversiblecavitation). Allowed values are: 
  + `"none"` - no refilling.
  + `"annual"` - every first day of the year.
  + `"total"` - instantaneous complete refilling.
  + `"rate"` - following a rate of new sapwood formation.

### Model output {#basicwaterbalanceoutput}

Functions `spwb()` and `pwb()` return a list of a class with the same name. The first four elements of this list (i.e., `latitude`, `topography`, `weather` and `spwbInput`) are simply copies of model inputs. The next element is `spwbOutput`, which contains the state of the input object at the end of the simulation (this can be used to perform further simulations starting with current values of state variables). The next five elements correspond to *water balance flows*, *soil state* variables, *stand-level* variables, *plant-level* and *fire hazard* results:

| Element | Description                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WaterBalance`| Climatic input and water balance flows of eq.\@ref(eq:basicwaterbalanceequation) (i.e. net precipitation, infiltration, runoff, transpiration...). All of them in $mm = l \cdot m^{-2}$. |
| `Soil`| Soil variables for each soil layer: Moisture relative to field capacity ($W_s$), water potential ($\Psi_s$) and volumetric water content ($V_s$). |
| `Stand`| Stand-level variables, such as $LAI^{\phi}_{stand}$, $LAI^{dead}_{stand}$, the water retention capacity of the canopy ($S_{canopy}$) or the fraction of light reaching the ground ($L^{PAR}_{ground}$ and $L^{SWR}_{ground}$).|
| `Plants`| Variables defined at the level of woody plant cohort, such as expanded leaf area ($LAI^{phi}_i$), transpiration, photosynthesis, water potential, etc. |
| `FireHazard`| Fire hazard variables (fuel moisture, rate of spread, fire potentials, etc). Only returned if `fireHazardResults = TRUE`. |

Elements `WaterBalance`, `Soil`, `Stand` and `FireHazard` are data frames with dates in rows and variables in columns, whereas `Plants` is itself a list with several data frames, with dates in rows and woody plant cohorts in columns:

| Element | Symbol | Units | Description                               |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
|`LAI`| $LAI^{\phi}$ | $m^2 \cdot m^{-2}$ | Leaf area index (expanded).|
|`LAIlive`| $LAI^{live}$ | $m^2 \cdot m^{-2}$ | Leaf area index (live).|
|`AbsorbedSWRFraction` | $f_i$ | [0-1] | Fraction of shortwave radiation absorbed.|
|`Transpiration`| $Tr$ | mm | Transpiration per unit ground area.|
|`GrossPhotosynthesis`| $A_{g}$ | $g\,C \cdot m^{-2}$ | Gross photosynthesis per unit ground area.|
|`PlantPsi` | $\Psi_{plant}$ | $MPa$ | Plant water potential.|
|`LeafPLC` | $PLC_{leaf}$ | [0-1] | Degree of leaf embolisation.|
|`StemPLC` | $PLC_{stem}$ | [0-1] | Degree of stem embolisation.|
| `PlantWaterBalance` | | mm | Internal daily plant water balance (balance of soil extraction and transpiration). |
| `LeafRWC`| $RWC_{leaf}$ | % | Mean leaf relative water content. |
| `StemRWC`| $RWC_{stem}$ | % | Mean stem relative water content. |
| `LFMC`| $LFMC$ | % | Live fuel moisture content (as percent of dry weight), corresponding to fine fuels (< 6.35 mm twigs and leaves). |
|`PlantStress` | $DDS$ | [0-1] | Drought stress level suffered by each plant cohort (relative whole-plant transpiration).|

The output of simulations can be inspected using `plot`, `shinyplot` and `summary` functions specific to `spwb` objects (examples are given in the corresponding package *vignette*).

As it simulates water balance for only one day, function `spwb_day()` returns a much more reduced output. This function is most useful with advanced water balance modelling (chapter \@ref(advancedwaterbalance)).

## Applications {#basicwaterbalanceapplications}

The basic water balance model is easier to parameterize and is faster the advanced water balance model. These features make it appropriate for applications that do not seek a high predictive capacity of water status at the plant level, but require robust estimates of water fluxes at the stand, landscape or regional levels. In our opinion the basic water balance model may be useful for the following applications: 

1. To monitor or forecast temporal variation in transpiration fluxes and soil water content in particular stands or in multiple stands across a landscape or region. 
2. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands or in multiple stands across a landscape or region (for example to anticipate mortality events).

For example, @karavani_effect_2018 employed the water balance to provide sound estimates of soil moisture dynamics to predict mushroom production in a network forest stands. The model is particularly interesting to test the relationship between forest structure/composition and the water balance at the stand level or the drought stress suffered by plants, as done in @Ameztegui2017. See also another application in @Rolo2019.
